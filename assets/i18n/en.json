				"T:Economic Character in Dairy Cattle:",
				"H:1.Lactation yield:",
				"The lactation yield in a lactation period is known as lactation yield. ‘The lactation yield in Indian breeds is very low compared to exotic breeds. This is dependent on no.. of calving, frequency of milking, persistency of yield .Normally in dairy cattle 30 - 40 % increase in milk production from first lactation to maturity is observed. After 3 or 4 lactation the production starts declining. For comparison of milk yield of different breeds and animals the milk yield should be converted into fat corrected milk (FCM). 4% FCM = 0.4 total milk + 15 total fat. After parturition the milk yield per day will be increased and reaches peak within 2-4 weeks after calving. This yield is known as peak yield. The maintenance of peak yield for more time is importance for better milk production. The lactation period in Indian breeds is low and so the production is also less and conversion.\n",
				"H:2. Lactation period:",
				"The length of milk producing period after calving is known as lactation period. The optimum lactation period is 305 days. The milk production will Breeding of dairy animals and farm records wil be less, if this period is shortened. Indian breeds will have less lactation period, but in some breeds this period is more with very little milk production.\n",
				"H:3. Persistency of Milk Yield:",
				"During lactation period the animal reaches maximum milk yield per day with in 2-4 weeks which is called peak yield. For high level of lactation yield, this peak yield should be maintained for longer period as far as possible, The maintenance of peak yield for long period is known as persistency, slow decrease in dairy milk yield after reaching peak yield in necessary. High persistency is necessary to maintain high level of milk production.\n",
				"H:4. Age at first calving:",
				"The age o the animal at first calving is very important for high life time production. The desirable age at first calving in Indian breeds is 3 years, 2 years in cross breed cattle and 3 1/2 years in Buffaloes. Prolonged age at first calving will have high production in the first lactation) but the life time production will be decreased due to less no of  calving. If the age at first calving is below optimum, the calves born are weak, difficulty in calving and less milk production in first lactation.\n",
				"H:5. Service period:",
				"It is the period between -date of calving and date of successful conception. The optimum service period helps the animal to recover from the stress of calving and also to get back the reproductive organs back to normal For cattle the optimum service period is 60-90 days. If the service period is too prolonged the calving interval prolonged, less no. of calving will be obtained in her life time and ultimately less life time production.’ If the service period is too short, the animal will become weak and persistency of milk production is poor due to immediate pregnancy.\n",
				"H:6. Dry Period:",
				"It is the period from the date of drying (stop of milk production) to next calving. When the animal in pregnancy, before next calving. The animal should be given rest period to compensate for growth of foctus. A minimum of 2 – 2 ½ months dry period should be allowed) If the dry period is not given or too low dry period, the animals suffer from stress and in next lactation, the milk production drops substantially and also it gives weak calves. On the other hand if the dry period given is too high, it may not have that much effect on increasing milk yield in the next lactation, but it decrease the production in the present lactation.\n",

				"H:8. Reproductive Efficiency:",
				"The reproductive efficiency means the more number of calves during life time, so that total life time production is increased, The reproduction or breeding efficiency is determined by the combined effect of hereditary and environment. Several measures of breeding efficiency like number of services per conception, calving interval, and days from first breeding to conception are useful. Reproductive efficiency has generally a low heritability value indicating that most of the variations in this trait is due to non genetic factors.

Records are the basis of selection and hence proper identification of animals and record keeping is essential. Cross-breed animals with exotic inheritance of about 50 percent are preferable. This preference is based on comparison of the performance of the animals with different percentage of exotic inheritance. Fifty percent of the native germplasm is helpful to retain the adaptability, heat tolerance and disease resistance traits of local animals, in cross breeds. The utilization of the Zebu (Sahiwal) germplasm in the formation of breeds like Australian Friesian Sahiwal (50% of Holstein and 50% Sahiwal) and its international recognition as a breed for the tropics is an example.\n\n\nMaintaining animals sustainable to the situation is the best policy.

				"\n",
				"Dehorning cattle conveys advantages. Horns are the single major cause of carcass wastage due to bruising, and trim associated with bruising for carcasses from horned cattle is approximately twice that for carcasses from hornless cattle. Dehorned cattle require less feeding trough space; are easier and less dangerous to handle and transport; present a lower risk of interference from dominant animals at feeding time; pose a reduced risk of injury to udders, flanks, and eyes of other cattle; present a lower injury risk for handlers, horses, and dogs; exhibit fewer aggressive behaviors associated with individual dominance; and may incur fewer financial penalties on sale.",
				"\n",
				"T:Disbudding:",
				"Disbudding involves destroying the horn-producing cells (corium) of the horn bud. Horn buds are removed without opening the frontal sinus. Chemical and hot-iron disbudding methods destroy the horn-producing cells, whereas physical methods of disbudding excise them. Several methods for disbudding cattle exist, but each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Hot-iron disbudding is commonly performed and is reliable, but is considered to be quite painful. Electrical and butane hot-iron disbudding devices are available. Excessive heat applied during hot-iron disbudding can damage underlying bone. Disbudding via cautery may create less distress than physical dehorning using a scoop because nociceptors are destroyed by heat and pain perception is consequently reduced. Caustic materials (e.g., sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide) applied to the horn bud can damage surrounding skin and/or the eyes if runoff occurs; as long as the active chemical is in contact with tissue, damage continues. Injection of calcium chloride under the horn bud results in necrosis of the horn bud, but its administration without prior sedation and/or local anesthesia is not recommended due to the level of discomfort induced by the procedure. Cryosurgical techniques are less reliable than hot-iron disbudding, require additional procedural time, and induce behavioral indicators of pain and distress. Horn buds can be physically removed, using knives, shears, or dehorning spoons, cups, or tubes. To remove the corium and prevent horn regrowth, a complete ring of hair surrounding the horn bud should also be removed.",
				"\n",
				"T:Dehorning:",
				"Dehorning is removal of the horns after they have formed from the horn bud. Physical methods of dehorning (gouge dehorning) include the use of embryotomy wire, guillotine shears, or dehorning knives, saws, spoons, cups, or tubes. The Barnes-type scoop dehorner is commonly used for physical dehorning.\nThe presence of the corneal diverticulum’s of the frontal sinus causes surgical dehorning of adult cattle to be more invasive. Dehorning of adult cattle is associated with increased risks of sinusitis, bleeding, prolonged wound healing, and infection.",
				"\n",
				"T:Points to remember",
				"\n",
				"Disbudding of calves and kids means removing the very early developing horn base to prevent horn growth. It’s a procedure carried out routinely for management reasons.\n\nIt is good practice to disbud all calves unless they are of a naturally polled type. Horns can cause a lot of damage to other cattle, and to stock handlers, particularly when they are yarded or penned or transported.\n\nHorned cattle should be penned separately for transport.\nThere are advantages in disbudding goat kids too. Goats with horns can use them to good effect on other goats, and horns get hooked up in fences.\nHorn buds begin to appear around the time of birth or within a week or so of birth.\nDisbudding should be carried out while the buds are still very small, well before they become too large for a disbudding iron to fit over.\nFeel around the poll of young calves daily from a few days of age to check the horn buds, and disbud as soon as they form small hard caps.\nFor most calves the best age for disbudding is from 3 to 6 weeks of age.\nGoat horns often appear earlier than calf horns and they grow faster, so check kids daily from birth.\nHot iron\n\nThe most humane method is use of a custom-made circular hot iron to cauterize the tissue around the base of the horn.\nThe procedure should take only a few seconds, but it’s painful, skill is required and applying a hot iron to the head requires firm restraint of the animal.\nDon’t be too forceful, especially with goat kids. Because of their smaller size and thinner skull they are more prone to injury from excess force or deep burns.\nDon’t use caustic paste\n\nThere are caustic chemicals on the market for disbudding.\nThese are applied to the horn bud to cause chemical burns to permanently damage the horn-producing area.\nThe caustic chemicals are easily rubbed onto sensitive skin (like the youngster’s mother’s udder or other calves!), and in wet conditions they can be washed down the face, causing painful burns.\nThe risks generally don’t justify use of caustic pastes for disbudding.\nDisbudding using a scoop\n\nAnother method of disbudding calves is by amputation using a metal scoop.\nThe disbudding scoop is a special instrument designed to gouge out the small horn bud and its base.\nThere is bleeding, more chance of infection than with cautery disbudding and it is a painful procedure.",
				"--------------------------------------------------------------------",
				"Get a vet to do it!\n\nFor the animal’s sake, disbudding is best carried out by a veterinarian using a gas or electric cautery iron with appropriate pain control (a strong sedative, pain killer and/or anesthetic).\n\nThe few dollars extra per calf or kid is a small price to pay for a painless and relatively stress-free procedure with a quick recovery and no complications such as infections.\n\nEmploying a vet also means that castration, tagging and any minor surgical procedures like removal of extra teats can be carried out painlessly at the same time.\n\nDisbud early\nIt is much more humane to disbud calves than to dehorn older cattle. The greater size and strength of older animals make them much more difficult to restrain for dehorning, there is more bleeding and a greater risk of infection.",
				"--------------------------------------------------------------------",
				"T:Deworming:",
				"Monthly once periodical Deworming is essential. Check the cowdung often, so that we can detect the worm infection if present.Likewise periodical deworming is reduce the Worm infection at calves and induce the growth & puberty.So that we can get high yield of weight and Milk.\n\nFrequent cheking of weight should be there to know about the growth.Then proper exercise have to provide to make the animal Healthy.\n",
				"T:Castration:",
				"It is very common for young male sheep, goats and calves to be castrated, because castrated animals are usually easier to manage from the age of puberty, i.e. from about 6 months of age.\n\nDon’t castrate if you don’t have to do. For example, there is no need to castrate lambs that are destined to be killed before they are 6 months old. But of course you should make sure that they are kept separate from females from about 4 months of age  just in case.\n\nIt goes without saying - castration is very painful unless it’s done skillfully.\n\nThe most humane option is to have the procedure carried out by a veterinarian using sedatives, pain killers and/or anesthetics; although many farmers consider that the costs of this make it impractical.\n\nMost castration of ruminants is carried out by the farmer owners, and it is best for the animal that the least stressful procedures be used and carried out while the animal is very young.\n\nFor castration of lambs, kids and calves, the most humane method is application of a custom-made rubber ring to the neck of the scrotum with the appropriate applicator, preferable while the animal is 7 to 10 days of age and definitely before it is 6 weeks old.\n\nSurgical castration, ie cutting the scrotum and pulling the testicles out, is another option.\n\nSurgical castration is a painful operation unless it’s carried out by a veterinarian using pain control.\n\nKeep surgical instruments clean and disinfect them between animals.\nSurgical castration is more traumatic than use of rings and there is more risk of complications like infections, so it is generally not a good method for lifestyle farmers to use.\n\nThe risk of infections like tetanus is reduced if the mother of the animal has been fully vaccinated against clostridial diseases.\n\nThe older the animal, the more potential there is for the operation to be painful and stressful.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone except a veterinarian to castrate animals of any species other than sheep, goats and cattle\n\n"

Be sure to feed the calf enough of colostrums between 2 to 2.5 liters daily for the first 3 days following its birth.\n\nAny excess colostrums may be fed to other calves in the herd in amounts equal to the amount of whole milk normally fed. If possible where a cow is milked before calving, freeze some of the colostrums for later feeding to the calf. None of it should be wasted. The digestibility of colostrums increases when it is given at a temperature between 99oF and 102oF. The importance of colostrums can be felt more from the following virtues.\n\nThe protein of colostrums consists of a much higher proportion of globulin than doe’s normal milk. The globulins are presumed to be the source of antibodies which aid in protecting the animal from many infections liable to affect it after birth. Gamma - globulin level in blood serum of neonatal calves is only 0.97 mg/ml at birth. It increase to 16.55 mg/ml level after first colostrums feeding at 12 hr and subsequently on the second day shows a peak of 28.18 mg/ml. This level more or less persists till the reti-culoendothelial system of the calf starts functioning to produce antibodies.",

Half the roughage ration can be fed in the forenoon after watering and cleaning the animals. The other half is fed in the evening, after milking and watering.

For economic milk production a cow producing not less than 2500 kg milk in 305 days lactation period is desirable. In general, selecting a newly calved cow yielding ten liters per day may have 2000-2500 kg lactation yield and cow yielding 15 liters per day initially may have a lactation yield of 3000 kg. A peak yield of at least 12 kg milk per day can be used as a criterion for this. Age at first calving should be less than 3 years. The interval between two successive calving should be 12 to 15 months. The cow should not have any physical deformity and should possess dairy conformation like well developed udder, prominent milk vein, squarely placed teats, ease in milking and good temperament. Old and unproductive cows are to be replaced by young cows. The calves reared in the farm itself are usually used for replacement. Normally, 20 percent of the stock has to be replaced each year.

				"\n\nBulls contribute 50 percent of the inheritance to the next generation. Most of the genetic improvement in a population comes through proper bull selection. It is not very practicable to have intense selection of the females for breeding i.e., almost all the heifers will have to be reared and used for breeding in a situation where age at first calving and calving interval are not optimum. Hence most care is to be given for bull selection. To achieve the goal of average 305 days milk yield of 2500 kg/lactation from the present 1600 kg for crossbreds in Kerala, the bulls used should be proven bulls or of high pedigree. The young bulls used for breeding should be from dams with lactation milk production not less than 4500 kg and bulls with higher sire index. If 1000 cows with this production performance are available in the State, this bull dam selection becomes feasible. Other economic traits like milk fat and SNF, age at first calving, calving ease, incidence of diseases etc., should be included in evaluation.\n\nThe farmers should be aware of the quality of bull used for breeding and all Artificial Insemination centres/bull stations should display the details of breeding value of the bulls used. Breeding value is generally expressed as a deviation from the population average. It is to be borne in mind that pedigree selection is the most important of all kinds of selection. Progeny testing is the most accurate method and as a rule bulls for progeny testing are selected based on the pedigree. Selection should be continuous and applied in all generations.

				"H:CATTLE BREEDING:",
				"Cattle’s rearing is an important subsidiary to agriculture in India. It has been playing a significant role in India's rural economy. Despite its vast cattle population, India's place regarding cattle productivity is at the rock-bottom vis-a-vis other countries, especially western ones. One of the major reasons for this is the lack of good breeding stock as well as technologies in our villages. The follwing poits describes different aspects of scientific breeding of cattle and buffaloes.",
				"\n\nI. Introduction",
				"Image:assets/images/mating.png",
				"\n\nReproduction is an important consideration in the economics of cattle production. In the absence of regular breeding and calving at the appropriate time cattle rearing will not be profitable. A healthy calf each year is the usual goal. This is possible only by increasing the reproductive efficiency of the animals.\n\nSuccessful reproduction encompasses the ability to mate, the capacity to conceive and to nourish the embryo and deliver the viable young ones at the end of a normal gestation period. In fact, interruption in this chain of events leads to failure of the cow either to conceive or the embryo to die or to have a premature delivery of the foetus.\n\nThe reproductive efficiency is a complex phenomenon controlled by both genetic and non-genetic factors, the non- genetic factors being climate, nutrition, and level of management. The reproductive efficiency varies not only between species and breeds but also among the animals within the Same breed. Even the best feeding and management can not coax performance beyond the genetic limit of an inferior animal. Improving the genetic merits of livestock populations is important at all levels of management. A sound breeding programme is a necessary part of the total animal production system. It is absolutely imperative to improve the productive capacity and physical appearance of the animal population.",
				"\n\nII. Factors Affecting Breeding Efficiency\n\nThe factors which influence the breeding efficiency of cattle are as follows:\n\n1. Number of ova\n\nThe first limitation on the breeding efficiency of fertility of an animal is the number of functional ova released during each cycle of ovulation. Ovulation is the process of shedding of ovum from the Graffian follicle. In the case of cow, usually a single ovum is capable of undergoing fertilization only for a period of 5-10 hours. Therefore, the time of mating in relation to ovulation is important for effective fertilization.\n\n2. Percentage of fertilization\n\nThe second limitation is fertilization of ova. Failure to be fertilized may result from several causes. The spermatozoa may be few or low in vitality. The service may be either too early or too late. so that the sperms and eggs do not meet at the right moment, to result in fertilization.\n\n3. Embryonic death\n\nFrom the time of fertilization till birth, embryonic mortality may occur due to a variety of reasons. Hormone deficiency or imbalance may cause failure of implantation of fertilized ova which die subsequently. Death may occur as a result of lethal genes for which the embryos are homozygous. Other causes may be accidents in development, over-crowding in the uterus, insufficient nutrition or infections in tile uterus.",
				"\n4. Age of first pregnancy\n\nBreeding efficiency may be lowered seriously by increasing the age of first breeding. Females bred at a lower age are likely to appear stunted during the first lactation, but their mature size is affected little by their having been bred early.\n\n5. Frequency of pregnancy\n\nThe breeding efficiency can be greatly enhanced by lowering the interval between successive pregnancies. The wise general policy is to breed for the first time at an early age and to rebreed at almost the earliest opportunity after each pregnancy. In this way the lifetime efficiency is increased. Cows can be rebred in 9-12 weeks after parturition.\n\n6. Longevity\n\nThe length of life of the parent is an important part of breeding efficiency, because the return over feed cost is greater in increased length of life. Also, it affects the possibility of improving the breed. The longer the life of the parents, the smaller the percentage of cows needed for replacement every year.\n\nIII. Management Practices to Improve Breeding Efficiency\n\nSome of the management suggestions which will tend to improve breeding efficiency of cattle are listed below.\n\nKeep accurate breeding records of dates of heat, service and parturition. Use records in predicting the dates of heat and observe the females carefully for heat.\nBreed cows near the end of heat period.\nHave females with abnormal discharges examined and treated by veterinarian.\nCall a veterinarian to examine females not settled after three services.\nGet the females checked for pregnancy at the proper time after breeding.\nBuy replacements only from healthy herds and test them before putting them in your herd.\nHave the females give birth in isolation, preferably in a parturition room and clean up and sterilize the area once parturition is over.\nFollow a programme of disease prevention, test and vaccination for diseases affecting reproduction and vaccinate the animals against such diseases.\nPractice a general sanitation programme.\nSupply adequate nutrition.\nEmploy the correct technique.\nProvide suitable shelter management.\nDetect silent or mild heat, by using a teaser bull.\n"

This removes any dirt from the teat canal and gives the operator a chance to detect mastitis.",
				"Milking is done either by stripping or by full hand method. Stripping is done by firmly holding the teat between the thumb and fore finger and drawing it down the length of the teat and at the same time pressing it to cause the milk to flow down in a stream. Grasping the teat with all the five fingers and pressing it against the palm does fisting or full hand milking. The teat is compressed and relaxed alternatively in quick succession, thus the method removes milk much quicker than stripping as there is no loss of time in changing the position of the hand. Further full hand method is superior to stripping as it stimulates the natural suckling process by calf and moreover the method exerts an equal pressure on the large teats of cows and buffaloes.",
				"Many milkers during milking tend to bend their thumb against the teat. The method is known as knuckling which should always be avoided to prevent injuries of the teat tissues. Thus milking should always be done with full hand unless the teats are too small or towards the completion of milking.

				"T:Udder infection:",
				"Image:assets/images/udder_infection.png",
				"\n\nThe essential requirements are to maintain udders free from infection (eg. mastitis); manage cows so that their udders and teats are clean; milk them in such a way that minimizes bacterial contamination; store the milk in clean containers and, wherever possible, at temperatures which discourage bacterial growth until collected. Simple and low-cost husbandry practices enable milk to be produced with a bacterial count of less than 50,000 per ml. The golden rule of clean milk production is that prevention is better than cure.\n\nIt is impossible to prevent mastitis infection entirely but by adopting practical routines it can be kept at low levels. Most mastitis is sub clinical and although not readily detected by the stockman, it will not normally raise the bacterial count of herd milk above 50,000 per ml. Once the clinical stage is reached, the count may increase to several millions/ml and one infected quarter may result in the milk from the whole herd being unacceptable. It is important to detect clinical cases and exclude their milk from the bulk.",
				"H:Other sources of contamination:",
				"Under normal grazing conditions, cows' udders will appear clean and therefore washing and drying will be unnecessary. Otherwise, any visible dirt must be removed using clean, running water, individual paper towels or cloths in clean water to which a disinfectant has been added (eg. sodium hypochlorite at 300 ppm). If udder cloths are used, provide a clean cloth for each cow. After each milking wash and disinfect them and hang up to dry. Disposable paper towels are preferable and more effective for drying after washing. When cows are housed or graze in heavily stocked paddocks, external udder surfaces are usually grossly contaminated with bacteria even when they appear visibly clean, therefore routine udder preparation procedures should be followed. Whenever udders are washed they should be dried.\n",
				"H:Cleaning milk production equipment:",
				"It is virtually impossible with practical cleaning systems to remove all milk residues and deposits from the milk contact surfaces of milking equipment. Except in very cold, dry weather, bacteria will multiply on these surfaces during the interval between milking, so that high numbers ( 106 per m2) can be present on visually clean equipment. A proven cleaning and disinfectant routine is required so that with the minimum of effort and expense, the equipment will have low bacterial counts as well as being visually clean. The essential requirements are, to use milking equipment with smooth milk contact surfaces with minimal joints and crevices, an uncontaminated water supply, detergents to remove deposits and milk residues and a method of disinfection to kill bacteria.\n",
				"H:Water supplies",
				"Unless an approved piped supply is available it must be assumed that water is contaminated and therefore hypochlorite must be added at the rate of 50 ppm to the cleaning water. Hard water (ie. high levels of dissolved calcium and other salts) will cause surface deposits on equipment and reduce cleaning effectiveness. In such case, it is necessary to use de-scaling acids such as Sulphuric or phosphoric, periodically.\n",
				"H:Detergents and disinfectants",
				"Detergents increase the 'wetting' potential over the surfaces to be cleaned, displace milk deposits, dissolve milk protein, emulsify the fat and aid the removal of dirt. Detergent effectiveness is usually increased with increasing water temperature, and by using the correct concentration and time of application. ",
				"Detergents contain inorganic alkalis (eg. sodium carbonate and silicates and tri-sodium phosphate), surface-active agents (or wetting agents), sequestering (water-softening) agents (eg. polyphosphates) and acids for de-scaling. Many proprietary, purpose-made detergents are usually available, but otherwise, an inexpensive mixture can be made to give a concentration in solution of 0.25% sodium carbonate (washing soda) and 0.05% polyphosphate (Calgon).",
				"Disinfectants are required to destroy the bacteria remaining and subsequently multiplying on the cleaned surfaces. The alternatives are either heat applied as hot water or chemicals. Heat penetrates deposits and crevices and kills bacteria, providing that correct temperatures are maintained during the process of disinfection. The effectiveness of chemicals is increased with temperature but even so, they do not have the same penetration potential as heat and they will not effectively disinfect milk contact surfaces which are difficult to clean.",
				"When hot water alone is used, it is best to begin the routine with water at not less than 85°C, so that a temperature of at least 77°C can be maintained for at least 2 minutes.",
				"Dairy disinfectants are sold as concentrates and in this form are often corrosive and damaging to the skin and eyes. They should always be so labeled, handled with care and stored out of reach of children. Disinfectants should not be mixed unless specific instructions are given and disinfectant powders must be kept dry. If any concentrated detergent and/or disinfectant comes in contact with the skin or eyes the affected area should be washed immediately with copious amounts of clean water. Clean and disinfect the ancillary equipment such as coolers, foremilk cups and udder cloths effectively using hot detergent/disinfectant solution.",
				"Drain and store all the milking and ancillary equipment in a clean place such as the dairy of the milking premises",
				"H:Milking premises",
				"The milking premises should have a dairy or suitable place equipped with a piped hot and cold water supply, a wash trough, brushes, a work surface, storage racks and cupboards and, if necessary, a vacuum pipeline connection. In addition, it is advisable to have a dairy thermometer (0°C - 100°C), rubber gloves and goggles for use when handling chemicals.\n",
				"H:Daily routines",
				"Daily routines for cleaning and disinfecting vary with the size and complexity of the milking installation but will include methods of removing dirt and milk from the equipment followed by disinfection. For hand milking, bucket and direct-to-can milking machines, basic manual methods of cleaning and sterilizing are adequate and effective. For pipeline milking machines in-situ (in-place) systems are necessary.\n\nMilk can become grossly contaminated from bacteria on ancillary equipment which must also be cleaned and disinfected effectively. Coolers, either the corrugated surface or the turbine in-can, can best be cleaned and disinfected manually and stored in the dairy to drain. Refrigerated bulk milk tanks can be cleaned either manually using cold or warm detergent/disinfectant solutions, or for the larger tanks, by automatic, programmed equipment. In either case, a cold water chlorinated (50 ppm) rinse proceeds and follows the washing solution. Foremilk cups can be a potent source of bacterial contamination and need to be cleaned and disinfected after each milking. They should then be stored in the dairy to drain.\n\nIt is important with any method of cleaning that the equipment is drained as soon as possible after washing for storage between milking. Bacteria will not multiply in dry conditions but water lodged in milking equipment will, in suitable temperatures, provide conditions for massive bacterial multiplication. Equipment with poor milk contact surfaces, crevices and large number of joints, remaining wet between milking in ambient temperatures above 20°C, should receive a disinfectant rinse (50 ppm available chlorine) before milking begins.\n"

				"In this process, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. The first scientific research in artificial insemination of domestic animals was performed on dogs in 1780 by the Italian scientist, Lazanno Spalbanzani. ",
				"His experiments proved that the fertilizing power reside in the spermatozoa and not in the liquid portion of semen. Few further studies under research station conditions helped this technique to be used commercially allover the world including India.\n",
				"Artificial insemination is not merely a novel method of bringing about impregnation in females. Instead, it is a powerful tool mostly employed for livestock improvement. In artificial insemination the germplasm of the bulls of superior quality can be effectively utilized with the least regard for their location in far away places.",

				"H:SEMEN COLLECTION METHOD. (A.V.)",
				"The cow or dummy is secured in service create. The artificial vagina assembled is held at 45° angle from the direction of penis, and the thrust is that angle. The artificial vagina is held with the left hand by a right handed person; and when the bull mounts the cow, the sheath of the bull will be graphed by the operator, directing the gland penis into the artificial vagina, and then the bull gives a thrust to ejaculate.\n\nThe operator should evince care so as not to touch the exposed past of the penis. After the bull dismounts, the artificial vagina is taken off from penis and the air vent is opened to release the pressure from the jacket.\n\nThe water from the jacket is also drained by opening the nostle. This allows the ejaculate to flow from the cone to the semen collection tube. The semen collection tube is detached from the cone, plugged with cotton wool, and taken to the laboratory for examination. The rubber cone and the semen collection tube can be protected from external contamination or heat or higher, by covering with an insulation bag with zip.",

				"Freezing of semen for successful preservation of spermatozoa, for long periods, is of great importance in livestock breeding and farm management. It has made it possible” to make available the use of outstanding proven sizes for larger number of cows, covering larger area, frozen semen shipment has become possible to different continents in the globe to any place connected with any service. Now a day if farmer wants to use of an outstanding size for inheritance of high milk yield, he can go in for frozen semen service provided his area is, covered by Artificial insemination, with supply of frozen semen.\n\nAt present frozen semen is used in most of the states in India. The technique of semen preservation in straws was developed in France . Freezing of semen is done with a special diluents, which has the following composition.\nSodium citrate dihydrate (angular) 2.4 y. 2.0 gm 8.0 ml 25.0%byvolume 50,000 units per 100 ml of semen Fructose Glycerol Egg Yolk Penicillin dilulent. Dihydro-streptomycin 50.0 mg per .100m1 of semen dilulent. Distilled water double glass distilled 100.Om1. The addition of glycerol to the dilulent makes the cells more resistant to the rigours of freezing and icy crystals, which form are smaller and smoother thus creating less damage to the spermatozoa. The addition of fructose to the diluent luprores sperm resistance to glycerol; and also provides nutrition.\n\nFrozen semen is packed in single dose glass vials or plastic straws at +5°C. The final level of glycerol should be 7.0 to 7.6% during the freezing process. The antibiotics are added to inhibit bacteria and to kill pathetic organisms. The semen to be diluted in such a way that one ml. of extended semen will contain 20 million motile spermatozoa. The semen must be cooled carefully for spermatozoa to remain with life. The final temperature is lowered to -79°C or still lower. Quick freezing is done for a period of 3 to 5 minutes to -75°C with the help of atmosphere created by liquid nitrogen. In the slow freezing  technique cooling is done at the rate of 1 °C per minute from +5°C to -15°C. From -15°C to -31 °C at the rate of 2°C per minute. From -31°C to 75°C at the rate of 4 to 5°C per minute. Thus taking 40 minutes in total, further cooling to -96°C can be done quickly as it is not critical after freezing. Before freezing the diluted semen in equilibreated for 3 to 5 hours or for the best 16 to 20, hours period in refrigerator at 5°C. Frozen semen facilitates the percent use of the semen diluted and frozen, and thus the delivery price is reduced, and it can be supplied with the gaps of months to the A.I technicians as against the supply of fluid semen every days or alternate days. Liquid nitrogen plays a vital role for storing the frozen semen straws, at a temperature of -196°C for longer periods.",
				"H:Artificial insemination (AI) of cattle:",
				"Artificial insemination (AI) is the process of collecting sperm cells from a male animal and manually depositing them into the reproductive tract of a female. One can cite a number of potential benefits from the use of artificial insemination.\n\nIncreased efficiency of bull usage\nDuring natural breeding, a male will deposit much more semen than is theoretically needed to produce a pregnancy. In addition, natural breeding is physically stressful. Both of these factors limit the number of natural mating a male can make. However, collected semen can be diluted and extended to create hundreds of doses from a single ejaculate. Also, semen can be easily transported; allowing multiple females in different geographical locations to be inseminated simultaneously, and semen can be stored for long periods of time, meaning that males can produce offspring long after their natural reproductive lives end.\n\nIncreased potential for genetic selection\nBecause artificial insemination allows males to produce more offspring, fewer males are needed. Therefore, one can choose only the few best males for use as parents, increasing the selection intensity. Furthermore, because males can have more offspring, their offspring can be used in a progeny test program to more accurately evaluate the genetic value of the male. Finally, individual farmers can use artificial insemination to increase the genetic pool with which his or her animals can be mated, potentially decreasing effects of inbreeding.\n",
				"H:Decreased costs",
				"Male animals often grow to be larger than females and can consume relatively larger amounts of feed. Also, male animals are often more strong, powerful, and potentially ill-mannered and thus require special housing and handling equipment.\n\nIncreased safety for animals and farmers\nAs mentioned, male animals can become large and aggressive. These factors mean that maintaining a bull on a farm may be dangerous. Also, because of the relatively larger size of adult males than females, natural mating is more likely to result accidents and injury to either the cow or the bull than is artificial insemination.\n\nReduced disease transmission\nNatural mating allows for the transfer of venereal diseases between males and females. Some pathogens can be transmitted in semen through artificial insemination, but the collection process allows for the screening of disease agents. Collected semen is also routinely checked for quality, which can help avoid problems associated with male infertility.\nArtificial insemination has some potential drawbacks, however, that must be considered. First, it can be more laborious. Male animals instinctively detect the females that are in the correct status for conception. With artificial insemination the detection work falls on the responsibility of the farmer. Poor detection results in decreased rates of fertility. Also, increasing the number of offspring per male has selective advantages only if the best males can be accurately determined. Otherwise this process only decreases the genetic variability in a population. Increasing the number of offspring per male always reduces the gene pool. The benefits of more intense selection must be balanced against the negative effects of decreased variation.",
				"H:ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION TECHNIQUES",
				"The technique of inseminating a cow is a skill requiring adequate knowledge, experience and patience. Improper AI techniques can negate all other efforts to obtain conception.",
				"Semen must be deposited within the tract of the cow at the best location and at the best time to obtain acceptable conception rates. Early methods of AI involved deposition of the semen in the vagina, as would occur in natural mating.",
				"Those methods are not satisfactory. Fertility is low and greater numbers of sperm are required. Another method which gained popularity was the \"speculum\" method.",
				" This method is easily learned, but proper cleaning and sterilizing of the equipment is necessary, making it more impractical to inseminate than with the rectovaginal technique which is the most widely used AI method today.\n",
				"In the recto-vaginal technique a sterile, disposable catheter containing the thawed semen is inserted into the vagina and then guided into the cervix by means of a gloved hand in the rectum. The inseminating catheter is passed through the spiral folds of the cow's cervix into the uterus. ",
				"Part of the semen is deposited just inside the uterus and the remainder in the cervix as the catheter is withdrawn. Expulsion of the semen should be accomplished slowly and deliberately to avoid excessive sperm losses in the catheter. The body of the uterus is short; therefore, care should be taken not to penetrate too deeply which might cause physical injury.",
				"In animals previously inseminated, the catheter should not be forced through the cervix since pregnancy is a possibility. Since research data show little variation in conception rates when semen is placed in the cervix, uterine body or uterine horns, some people recommend incomplete penetration of the cervical canal and deposition of semen in the cervix.\n",
				"The recto-vaginal technique is more difficult to learn and practice is essential for acceptable proficiency but the advantages make this method of insemination more desirable than other known methods. With practice, the skillful technician soon learns to thread the cervix over the catheter with ease. If disposable catheters are used and proper sanitation measures are followed, there is little chance of infection being carried from one cow to another.\n",
				"H:Timing of Insemination for Maximum Conception",
				"A frequent question concerning AI is: What time during estrus should cows be bred for greatest chance of conception? Since estrus may last from 10 to 25 hours there is considerable latitude in possible time of insemination. Much research work has been conducted on this subject.\n",
				"Controlled investigations were conducted by Trim Berger and Davis at Nebraska in 1943. These and other studies show that conception rate is lower when cows are bred prior to mid estrus or later than 6 hours after cessation of estrus (standing heat in this case). Maximal conception is obtained when cows are inseminated between mid estrus and the end of standing estrus, with good results up to 6 hours after estrus.\n",
				"Success in insemination timing is dependent upon a good heat detection program. In large herds, this means assigning individual responsibility for heat detection and a continued education program for labor. A successful heat detection program and subsequent proper timing of insemination will pay dividends in increasing reproductive efficiency.",

Most of the animals in India re river type though swamp type are also found in certain parts of the country specially in eastern parts of India. \n\nIndia is considered as the home tract of some of the best buffalo breeds. \n\n Because of preference of buffaloes for milk, many she buffaloes from the breeding tract are moved to the thickly populated urban and industrial centre for meeting the milk requirements of this population.  Here generally they are slaughtered after completion of one or two lactation.  Their progenies allowed to die due to neglect and thus no replacement of superior germplasm is possible. \n\nIndian buffaloes are in important source of milk supply today and yield nearly three times as much milk as cows. More than half of the total milk produced (55%) in the country was contributed by the 47.22 million milch buffaloes, where as the 57.0 million cows contribute only 45% of the total milk yield.  Indian Buffaloes are water buffaloes.  There are about 10 indigenous standard breeds of buffaloes, which are well known for their milking qualities\n",

			"Feed management": [
				"T:FEEDING:",
				"\nBuffaloes are, like cattle, ruminants. This means that they utilize micro-organisms in the rumen to digest the feed.",
				" The feed eaten by ruminants are mainly of vegetable origin. The ruminant is an expert in converting cellulose and other fibrous materials into high quality milk and meat. ",
				"Their digestive capacity is greater than the non-ruminant. Ruminants” chew the cud\" e.g. regurgitate the food to the mouth and chew it several times, thus helping the breakdown.\n",
				"The feed will enter the rumen compartment when swallowed by the animal. The rumen is an anaerobe environment, e.g. no oxygen is present.",
				" The feed is exposed to microbes such as bacteria, protozoa and fungi.",
				" These microbes attack the feed particles and by enzymatic action the components are broken down and used for their own metabolism, growth and propagation.",
				" The feed is masticated, regurgitated and exposed to microbes in the rumen. Large particles will become smaller and eventually be transported to the reticulum and further on.",
				" How long time a specific feed particle will stay in the rumen depends on size, palatability and fiber content of the feed. ",
				"The buffalo has slower rumen movement than cattle, which leads to a slower rate of ingest outflow. The pH of the rumen content is similar to that of cattle, and it is affected in the same manner. ",
				"Normal pH is between 6 and 7 depending on feed and time of feeding.",
				"The components of the feed can be divided into protein, energy (carbohydrates), fat, minerals and water. ",
				"The breakdown and utilization of the different feed components are reviewed below.The waste end products of the microbial attack are methane and carbon dioxide which are eructated. ",
				"Volatile fatty acids (VFA) of which acetic, prop ionic and butyric acids are the predominant ones, are together with ammonia absorbed by the animal through the rumen wall, and transported via the blood to, e.g. the liver and udder where they serve as building material for chemical compounds such as glucose, protein and fat (see Figure 10). ",
				"Ammonia can be utilized directly by the rumen microbes to synthesize proteins. To be correct, one is actually not feeding the buffalo, but its’ microbes. ",
				"Ruminants are entirely dependent on the function of the rumen microbes. Therefore, it is important to keep the rumen environment healthy.",
				" The easiest and best way is to feed a high amount of good quality roughage and a smaller amount of good quality concentrate.\n",
				"H:Protein:",
				"Almost all protein is attacked by the microbes and utilized in their metabolism and incorporated in the microbial mass.",
				" Microbial protein is of high quality and is absorbed as amino acids after being digested by gastric enzymes in the abomasums.\n",
				"Ammonia which is absorbed by the rumen wall and transported by the blood to the liver, is converted to urea. In case of protein deficiency, urea can be utilized by the rumen microbes as a non-protein nitrogen source to build protein. ",
				"In this way nitrogen is circulated and efficiently used by the animal.\n",
				"Protein can be protected to withstand microbial attack. It is then called”by-pass protein”. By-pass protein is only degraded in the abomasums and small intestine where it undergoes enzymatic attack similar to that of mono-gastric animals.",
				" By-pass-protein is commercially available in some ready made concentrates and is usually given to high producers.\n",
				"H:Carbohydrate",
				"Carbohydrates are the predominant sources of energy for ruminants. Carbohydrates, or sugars, are the components of starch and fibers. Fiber is a common name for cell-wall components such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin. Starch can be degraded by animal gastric enzymes, whereas fibers cannot.",
				" Ruminants can utilize fibers to a larger extent than mono-gastric animals because of the ruminal microbes. However, lignin (wood-fiber) is not utilized. It is generally believed that buffaloes utilize fiber more efficiently than cattle do. The coefficient of digestion is 5-8% higher in buffaloes than in cattle.\n",
				"H:Fat",
				"Fat is not as such required in other than very small amounts for the ruminant. However, what ever fat is present in the feed undergoes microbial attack and degradation. Unsaturated fatty acids are hydrolyzed and thus saturated. This is one of the reasons for the milk and body fat of the ruminant to be of equal composition, largely independent of the type of feed given.",
				" If the fat can in some form be protected from ruminal degradation, and instead be utilized in the lower intestinal tract, it may be used as an additional energy source. ",
				"However, it may then alter the milk fat composition unfavorably. Too much unprotected fat in the diet depresses the ability of the microbes to ferment fibers, thus influencing the energy utilization negatively.\n\n",
				"H:Nutrient  requirements",
				"In order to utilize the animal, feed and economical resources as efficiently as possible, one must know the nutrient requirements of the animals. If an animal is wrongly fed this may lead to diseases, loss of production and thereby economical losses.",
				" By knowing what a specific animal needs, proper advice concerning purchase, cultivation and feeding systems can be given. Requirements for buffaloes are more or less the same as for cattle, therefore, nutrient requirement tables for dairy cattle may be used as a guidance, the farmer must observe the animals and change feeding system with the guidance of an extension officer if it seems\n",
				"H:Energy",
				"Sources of energy are predominantly carbohydrates like fiber and starch and fat to a lesser extent. For buffaloes, fiber in the form of roughage is the most important and cheapest energy source. When calculating feed ratios for buffaloes the term Metabolizable Energy (ME) is used. This means the amount of energy that can be used by the animal for maintenance, growth, lactation etc. ",
				"The gross energy (GE) of the feed is the amount present in the feed, when entering the animal, much of the energy is converted into heat which is lost through the thermal regulation. Energy is also lost in the feces and urine as well as in the methane and carbon dioxide gases.",
				"Energy is measured in calories (cal) and joules (J) (1 cal equals 4.18 J). The most common is to use the term Mega calories (M cal) or Mega joules (MJ) which means a million cal or J. Another measurement is Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) which is the sum of carbohydrates and fat in the diet. The unit for TDN is kg or gram.The energy ratio in the feed may be increased by adding fat in protected form, thus transferring the digestion from rumen to the intestinal tract. Feeding of protected fat (1 kg safflower oil) has proven to increase nutrient utilization. Feeding of unprotected fat in similar amounts has shown to adversely affect nutrient utilization.\n",
				"H:Protein",
				"Protein is required for growth, tissue repair and milk production among other things. Good sources of protein are leguminous forage, grain and oil-seed-cakes.\nThe protein requirements are measured in Crude protein (CP) in kg or gram.\n",
				"H:Minerals and vitamins",
				"Minerals are essential for many body functions. The macro-minerals calcium and phosphorus are especially important in milk production. They are also vital for the skeleton and the function of nerve-impulses. Phosphorus is the mineral included in the body’s energy metabolism, ATP. When considering the Ca and P requirements for the animal it is equally important to consider the ratio in which it is given. The Ca ration should be 2:1 since there exists and antagonist relationship between the two minerals concerning uptake from the small intestine.",
				"\nSalt, e.g. sodium and potassium together with chloride are the more important micro-minerals. Minerals are present in various amounts in feed and water.\nVitamins are essential for total body function. Most vitamins are synthesized by the animal or it's rumen microbes. Such vitamins, B, C and K (and to some extent D) does not need to be fed. Vitamin B is synthesized by ruminal microbes, vitamin K by intestinal microbes and vitamin C in the tissues. Vitamin D is formed when the precursor, found on the skin on animals and on grass, is exposed to UV-rays, in tropical countries deficiency of vitamin D is rare. Vitamins A and E are not synthesized in the animal but must be supplied. Vitamin A is found in silage, fresh grass, dark green leaves, peas and carrots. Cereals are a source of vitamin E.\n",
				"Mineral and/or vitamin mixture should always be supplied in order to fully meet the requirements. Animals which do not receive a ready made concentrate mixture with mineral and vitamin supplement, must be fed supplement in the form of ”lick stones” of which the animals have free access to or as ”powder” fed once or twice a day individually.",
				"Vitamins may be included in the mineral feed, but vitamins are more sensitive and may be destroyed if kept in sunlight. Care must therefore be taken to store vitamin supplements correctly.\n",
				"H:Water",
				"Water is essential for most body functions, such as body temperature control, milk production and maintaining blood plasma volume. Thermal regulation of the animal is the most water consuming process. The animal receives water in three different ways\n\nDrinking water\nWater in feed\nMetabolic water = water made from feed degradation\nDrinking water is the most important water source and should be of good hygienic quality. The water available in feed is highly dependent on the dry matter in feed. Straw, hay and cereals include little water, whereas silage and fresh grass may contain as much as 70 percent.\nThe water requirements of the buffalo depend on;\n",
				"The diet (dry matter)\nThe environment (humidity, temperature)\nPhysiological function (growth, pregnancy, lactation etc.)\nGenerally, buffaloes require more water than cattle under the same circumstances and should have access to clean cool water and libitum. A restricted water intake leads to a decrease in dry matter intake and thus affects milk production and growth negatively.\n",
				"Salinity of water is seldom a problem in dairy buffalo feeding. A salt content of up to 5 g/liter of water can be used for buffaloes. However, temporary diarrhea may be caused by water approaching the higher levels.\n",
				"H:Feedstuff",
				"The main diet for the buffalo is roughage such as grass, legumes and straw. The roughage can be fed either fresh as pasture or in a cut-and-carry-system or conserved as hay or silage. The roughage is often complemented with grains, concentrate and agro-industrial by-products such as oil-seed cakes, sugar cane tops etc.\n\nThe roughage should form the base of the feed ration and contribute to meet (at least) the total maintenance requirements. Grains and concentrate should be fed only to meet additional requirements such as growth, pregnancy and milk production. Too much non-fibrous feed will alter the rumen environment. In the long run this could lead to serious problems in feed digestion causing loss of appetite, weight loss and a drop in milk yield. This is especially important for animals under stress, such as high growth rate and high milk yield. The roughage should be of good quality, both nutritional and hygienic quality, this cannot be emphasized enough.\n\nTypes of roughage\n\nThe most common roughage is grass of a number of species. Lucerne, berseem and clover are herbaceous legumes and have an advantage over grass as they are nitrogen fixing. This means that the plants will (with the help of bacteria) fix air-nitrogen and thus they are less dependent on the nitrogen content of the soil. These plants contain more protein than grass under the same circumstances. Lucerne (or Alfalfa) has several advantages. It contains an elevated amount of calcium, vitamin E and carotene which are of major importance for milk production.\n\nThere are also tree legumes which can be used as high quality feed, e.g. Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricida spp., Sesbania and others. As many of the tree legumes contain anti-nutritional compounds which may depress digestibility as well as decrease feed intake, they should not be fed as the sole source of roughage. A maximum ratio of 50% tree legumes in the total diet can be considered as a safe level. Since buffaloes are strict grazers, the trees should be pruned and the branches or leaves given to the buffaloes. Pruning with regular interval of 6 to 10 weeks increases re-growth of the leaves.\n\nRoughage of lesser quality are straws. Straw from rice, barley, wheat, sorghum etc. are widely used in feeding ruminants. Their protein content is zero and their energy content low because of their largely lignified cell-walls. Rice or paddy straw has a high silica content in the cell walls which makes it difficult to digest.\n",
				"H:Harvesting roughage",
				"In the beginning of the growth season, the protein and sugar (energy) content of the grass is high and the lignin content low. Thus, the grass is of high quality. With maturity the protein and sugar content decreases and the cell walls become lignified. The growth pattern is the same for legumes although it is a little slower. It is therefore important to harvest the roughage in the optimal period and to conserve it for use under dry seasons.\n\n Pastures should not be over or under grazed. Over grazing leads to insufficient forage in the later season and the soil will be more vulnerable to erosion and permanent damage. In the case of under grazing, the pasture is not utilized efficiently. The grass will grow quicker than the animals can eat. Thus the nutrient composition will change unfavorably to high lignin and low protein content.\n",
				"In many areas, grass is not harvested even if not grazed and is left as \"standing hay\". However, the standing hay has a very low nutritive quality, close to that of straw.",
				"H:Treatment of roughage",
				"Chaffing, grinding and pelleting are ways to improve nutritive quality of straws to some extent by making the nutrients available to the rumen microbes. Chemical treatment with alkali or ammonia is effective ways of improving quality. Ammonia treated, chaffed straw may even substitute green forage for low milk producing buffaloes to some extent. Ensiling Lucerne reduces vitamin E and carotene content.\n",
				"H:Concentrate",
				"The term concentrate means that a high amount of nutrients are concentrated in a small amount of dry feed. The most typical concentrates for tropical countries are oilseed cakes of different types. Oilseed cakes are the common name for products that are derived of the oil for human use and the remainder is pressed together to form a cake. The cakes have relatively high energy content but are mostly used because of their very high protein content.\n\n Other types of feed which can be classified as concentrate are molasses and urea. Urea can be used by the microbes as a source of nitrogen. The use of urea also requires an easily fermented energy source for the micro-organisms e.g. molasses. The micro-organisms must always have a good balance between protein and energy in the rumen to be able to do their qualified job. There are a number of ready made concentrates on the market manufactured by various companies. Care should be taken to ensure that the quality of the concentrate is up to standard.\n",
				"H:Grain:",
				"Barley, wheat, oat, rye, maize and sorghum grains are excellent feed for ruminants, given in balanced amounts. However, since they are used for human consumption their use as animal feed is limited.\n",
				"H:Voluntary intake",
				"The definition of voluntary intake is the amount of feed an animal can eat per day. It is commonly expressed in kg of dry matter or in percent of live weight. After having considered the nutrient requirements of the animal and the feed stuff to be used the proper feeding regime can be calculated. However, one must take into consideration how much the animal can eat.\n\nA high producing lactating cow can eat more than a low producing. Similarly a growing heifer may eat more than a dry cow. As pointed out before, feed intake decreases with high environmental temperature and humidity. Individual feeding usually results in higher feed intake due to less competition for feed and a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nA rough estimation of voluntary intake for a buffalo heifer is 2.2 to 2.5% of its’ live weight per day, if provided with a small portion of straw, a large portion of green feed and some concentrate. A milk producing buffalo should be able to consume good quality feed up to 3% of its’ live weight. A too high ratio of straw in the diet reduces voluntary intake. A protein content of less than 6% also reduces intake of that feed.\n",
				"H:Practical feeding of the lactating buffalo",
				"Lactating buffaloes should be given the best feed the farm can offer. Producing milk is one of the most energy demanding biological processes. Weight loss is common in high producing animals during the first month of lactation because they cannot consume a sufficient amount of energy. A popular term is that the animals are milking off the fat. It is therefore important that the buffalo is in good health status at partus. In Table 6, examples of various feeding regimes for lactating buffaloes are given. A well balanced ratio of protein, energy, vitamins and minerals in a palatable and tasty feed is the best way of increasing milk production and live weight, as well as improving health and fertility.\n\nTraditional feeding patterns for buffaloes all over the world is subjected to forages and crop production of the season which affects the level of milk production. Forage is insufficient during the dry season and abundant during the rainy season. Shortages are overcome by conserving forages as hay or silage.",
				"H:Formulating feed ratios for the milk producing buffalo",
				"Formulating feed ratios for milk producing buffaloes starts with theoretical calculating of the requirements. As there are no standardized international tables for dairy buffaloes’ requirements, the calculations here are based on NCR’s tables for dairy cattle (see Table 3). It is important to know the buffaloes live weight, this is most accurately done by weighing the animals three times in a week and calculating the average. However, this requires an animal scale and is further very time consuming. Weighing the animals once is good as guidance. Once the weight is known, the requirements for maintenance are extracted from Table 1. The milk yield should be known as well as the fat percentage. Recommendations are at least 3 days of milk recording to calculate the average yield and fat percentage. For simplicity, the yield is then calculated to 4% fat corrected milk (shown in Table 1). The total requirement is gained by summing requirements for maintenance and for milk production",
				"H:\nTable 1. Nutrient requirements for milk producing buffaloes",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_feeding_table1.png",
				"If the animal seems to be too fat at the time of weighing, the maintenance requirements may be reduced by 10 %. Similarly, if the animal is too skinny, 10% may be added to the maintenance requirements.\n",
				"The feeding regime of the buffaloes can then be decided. Primarily, crops grown on the farm should be included in the diet. For the optimal economic feeding regimes the feed should be analyzed at a laboratory for dry matter content, energy and crude protein and for calcium and phosphorus.",
				"H:\nTable 2. Optimal economic feeding",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_feeding_table2.png",
				"H:Practical feeding of the calf\n",
				"Calf mortality is very high, in India it is often 30-40% before 3 months of age, and in Italy the figures may be higher. This is caused by malpractice such as negligence, limited milk feeding, injuries and diseases. ",
				"By increasing the amount of feed to the calf’s requirements and by practicing the following instructions the mortality can be decreased.\n",
				"Colostrum is the most important and most suitable feed for the newborn calf. It contains all the nutrients needed (see Table 3) along with the vital antibodies. It is crucial for the survival of the calf that it receives colostrums during the first 12 hours of its life, the earlier the better. The calves should be given colostrums as long as the mother provides it e.g. 3 to 4 days. Any surplus colostrum can be frozen and then thawed and carefully heated to 390C. If no freezing facilities are available colostrums can stay fresh for a couple of days if it is cooled in a hygienic container. Colostrum can be fermented with living lactic acid culture. Fermented colostrums can be kept for at least a week and up to two weeks if cooling facilities are available.\n\nIf the calf is not allowed to suckle its mother it should be provided with colostrums as soon as possible after birth. If it is not possible to feed the calf directly after milking the buffalo, colostrums should be cooled in order to maintain hygienic quality. When it is time to feed the calf, the milk should be carefully heated to no more than 390C. Colostrums must never be boiled. By boiling the milk the antibodies are destroyed and hence, cannot be utilized as such by the calf.\n\n The natural eating behavior of the calf is to suckle its mother often and to consume a small amount of milk at each suckling period. It is best for the calves reared under artificial conditions if their eating behavior is as”natural” as possible. Colostrum should be fed to the calf at least twice daily with equal intervals.\n\nThe calf should be trained to drink from a bucket. The easiest way to do this is to dip clean fingers into the milk and then allow the calf to lick and suck the fingers. The hand is then gradually drawn into the milk in the bucket while the calf is still suckling. Once the calf has learnt to drink it is easy to feed. The calf may need assistance for 5 days. There are special nipples which can be put in the bucket. The calf will suckle these, hence it will need less assistance from the trainer.",

				"H:\n\nTable 3: Feeding of the calf",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_feeding_table3.png",
				"After the colostrums period, whole milk should be provided to the calf until 15 days of age @ a level of 1/8th to 1/10th of the calf’s body weight. (see Table 3). Milk replacer can be fed along with the whole milk provided that it has a certain composition of nutrients. It is not advisable to completely substitute whole milk with milk replacer. Milk and/or replacer should be offered to the calf on at least two occasions per day. The milk and/or replacer should be served at body temperature (38-39OC).\n\n At two weeks of age, the calf should be introduced to good quality green feed and concentrates, as a calf starter (Table 3). This stimulates the rumen to grow and function properly. By following the feeding schedule in Table 8 a daily gain of 0.35 kg can be expected in Murrah calves",

				"Buffalo calves fed with Stover’s of maize, bajra and oat cannot meet their nutrient requirements and are often in negative energy and protein balance. However, feeding the calves with treated Stover’s with a urea-molasses-salt complex both enhances the palatability of the Stover’s as well as the digestibility and nutrient value. Buffalo male calves weighing 150-200 kg has proven to increase the intake of treated Stover’s verses untreated ones and thereby increasing weight gain, nitrogen balance and health.\n\n",

She must have an average daily gain of at least 500 grams per day in order to reach the optimum size for calving within reasonable time (500 kg at 32 to 40 months). Unfortunately, many farmers consider heifers to be unproductive and hence they are not properly fed. Lack of feed is often a reality; it is therefore not possible to feed all animals in the herd with high quality feed. The following advice could be considered as a rule of thumb, bearing in mind that the quantity and quality of feed varies with the season. Furthermore, the condition and growth rate of the heifer should be checked regularly to see that she has the approximate growth rate and if not, adjust her feeding schedule accordingly.\n\nThe heifers should be fed green feed of the season of about 4-7 kg DM together with some straw and concentrate or grain per day. If the green feed is leguminous the ration of green feed and concentrate or grain can be reduced and the amount of straw increased. However, it is positive to feed the heifers a small amount of grain or concentrate (not less than 0.5 kg per day) for making both them and their rumen accustomed to this type of feed, especially partus.\n\nIf available, ammonia treated straw could be given along with low quality green feed and concentrate. Silage could be given to heifers, but it is often a very valuable feed saved for milk producing animals. However, a few months before part us the heifer should slowly be introduced to the feed she will have as a milk producing buffalo.\n\nMaximum voluntary intake of the heifer is obtained @ approximately 1 to 1.5 kg dry matter of straw together with 3 kg (DM) of green feed and 1 kg concentrate. Straw fed to appetite is not enough to keep or increase body weight of growing buffaloes. Straw fed to growing stock should preferably be ammoniated and further supplemented with green feed or hay and some kind of concentrate to give the best result.\n",
				"H:Practical feeding of the dry buffalo",
				"Feeding the dry buffalo concern is preparing for partum and a high milk production. In the last two months of gestation the buffalo has increased requirements for nutrients for fetal growth. Experiments with Murrah buffaloes has shown that the best economical way of feeding dry buffaloes 2 months before calving is at 125% of the recommended level for cattle (NRC, 1988). By giving the dry buffalo a little more than she needs her chance to build up the body reserves and to be in good physical condition is improved. After calving the buffalo can be fed at 100% of recommended level for cattle\n\n",

				"T:Lactation and milk yield",
				"The onset of lactation is with the birth of the calf. The initial yield is a reliable indicator of the animal’s genetic potential. The highest yield is reached after five to six weeks of lactation and maintained for some weeks. ",
				"Thereafter the yield decreases until the end of lactation. The lactation ends as the dry period starts.\n",
				"In buffaloes, the highest milk yield is seen in the fourth lactation where after it declines. The shape of the lactation curve depends on factors such as feed, management, milking frequency, diseases among others. ",
				"The length of lactation and yield for various breeds is shown in Table 10. The optimum lactation length in the Murrah has been reported to be 262 to 295 days. Factors affecting lactation and milk yield\n",
				"Lactation and milk yield depend on both genetic and non-genetic factors. The genetic influence is due to species, breed, and individual. Further, it is affected by ability to reproduce, e.g. fertility and thereby calving interval. Improvement on these may be the result of breeding and selection.The non-genetic factors are management, amount and quality of feed and skill of the farmer to detect heat and illnesses. ",
				"Factors which are outside the farmer’s control such as climate, temperature, humidity etc. also influence lactation and milk yield.\n\nFeeding is the most important factor for increasing and sustaining the milk yield. Sufficient amount of energy, protein, minerals and water must be provided in order to achieve maximum yield. See section on Practical feeding of the lactating buffalo.Calving interval is closely related to lactation length and milk yield. The longer the calving interval, the longer the lactation and the higher the lactation yield. However, total life time yield will be substantially less comparing with a buffalo with short calving intervals.Milking frequency affects both total milk and fat yield.",
				"A study using Murrah buffaloes showed that 31% more milk and 26% more butter fat resulted from milking three times per day as compared to twice a day.\n\nWeight of the heifer seems to affect milk yield. Studies on Murrah indicates that the heifers should weigh at least 500 kg at the time of calving in order to reach a maximum milk yield.\n",
				"H:Dry period",
				"The buffalo should be dried off approximately 2 to 3 months before expected calving. The dry period is valuable to the buffalo, she may rest and the udder tissue is repaired.In a high yielding herd (above 10 kg per day) the buffalo should be dried off when the daily yield falls below 2.5 kg, even if it is still more than 3 months to expected calving. This goes especially for machine milked herds. An alternative to drying off is to use the buffalo as a foster mother to newly born calves. One buffalo may serve one newborn calf or two older calves which receive additional feed. Care should be taken to dry her off completely no later than 2 months before calving.\n\nIn herds which are hand milked and where the yield is low, it is difficult to set a lower limit in kg. Instead, the 2 months limit is recommended.",

				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_milking.png",
				"H:Composition of colostrums",
				"During approximately the first three days of lactation the buffalo secretes colostrums. Colostrums is vital for the newborn calf and its composition reflects the calf’s need (see Table 2). Colostrums contains the important proteins; the immuno globulins, which are the newborn calf’s source of antibodies. The content of iron and copper is markedly higher in the colostrums as compared to normal milk.\n\n",
				"H:Table 2: Composition of colostrums\n",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_milking_table2.png",
				"H:Alterations of milk composition",
				"Milk composition can be altered both before and after the milking. If the change occurs inside the udder it is mostly due to a disease or treatment of the disease by antibiotics or other type of medication. Feeding can alter the normal composition, however, these changes are seldom extreme, but within normal intervals. Season can effect the normal milk composition, although these changes are mostly due to differences in feeding during different seasons.\n",
				"H:Feedstuff",
				"Rule of thumb is that roughage increases fat content in milk, whereas concentrate depresses it. This depends on the differences in VFA production in the rumen from the different carbohydrate sources. Digestion of fiber results in a higher proportion of acetic acid and thereby more milk fat. Digestion of concentrate on the other hand, results in a higher proportion of propionic acid which is unfavorable for milk fat synthesis. If too much concentrate is given, fat depression might occur. Higher energy diets seem to give better coagulation properties of the milk. Long-chain fatty acids increase when the energy concentration in feed is low.\n\nGlucosinolates in Brassica spp. are hydrolyzed by the ruminal microbes into thiocyanates, iso- thiocyanates and some other products. Thiocyanate is then excreted in the milk. High feeding levels with Brassica spp. may therefore lead to unsatisfactory levels of thiocyanate in the milk. Thiocyanate may cause thyroid enlargement in animals as well as humans ingesting it. A common feed stuff of Brassica spp. is mustard fodder and mustard oil cake. Even 15 days after withdrawal of mustard feed, circulatory high levels of thiocyanate exists and is secreted in milk.\n",
				"H:medication",
				"Mastitis changes the milk composition dramatically. The alterations can sometimes be used as detection of the disease. If antibiotics are used in order to cure for example mastitis, these will be excreted in the milk. Controlling of external parasites with e.g. diazinon affects milk yield as well as composition. The chemical is detected in the milk upto 48 hours after dermal application.",
				"H:\n\nMilking the buffalo:",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_milkman.png",
				"\nBuffaloes have been used for milk production for centuries. They have not been subjected to the same upgrading and breeding like cattle of the western world. However, the buffalo is an excellent milk producer, given the correct circumstances. Milking the buffalo is not a difficult task. One should, however, take care not to implement cattle milking techniques directly on the buffalo cow. As described below, the anatomy and physiology of the buffalo udder differs slightly from the bovine one. This has further implications on the milking technique as mentioned later.",
				"H:Anatomy and physiology of the buffalo udder and teat",
				"The buffalo has an udder similar to the cattle in the gross anatomy. The buffalo has four teats. Extra teats can be found in the similar way as in cattle. The teats vary in shape and size. Generally, they are larger than cattle teats. According to several studies, cylindrical forms of the teats are most common in the Murrah breed. The front teats are, on average, 5.8 cm to 6.4 cm long and their diameter is approximately 2.5 cm to 2.6 cm. Respective figures for the hind teats are 6.9 cm to 7.8 cm and 2.6 to 2.8 cm.\n\nThe hind quarters of the udder are slightly larger than the front ones and contain more milk. The approximate ratio is 60:40 (hind: front), as for cattle. It takes a longer time to milk the hind quarters.\n\nThe anatomy of buffalo teats is slightly different from cattle teats. The epithelium of the streak canal is thicker and more compact in buffaloes than in cattle. The sphincter muscle around the streak canal is thicker in buffaloes than in cattle. More force is therefore required to open the streak canal. The teat sphincter tonus has been reported to be at least 400 mmHg negative pressures in buffaloes (the tension falls some what after calf suckling and hand milking). This is the cause of buffaloes being”hard milkers”.\n\nIn cattle, the milk is synthesized in the alveoli and is periodically transferred to the large ducts and cisterns of the mammary gland and the teat (see booklet on Efficient Milking). This is not the case in the buffalo, instead, the milk is held in the upper, glandular part of the udder, in the alveoli and small ducts. Between two milking there is no milk stored in the cistern. Hence, buffaloes have no cisternal milk fraction. The milk is expelled to the cistern only during actual milk ejection. The same phenomenon is seen in Chinese Yellow cows and Yaks.\n\nBecause of the absence of cistern milk between milking, in the teat cisterns, the teats are collapsed and soft before let down. This is contradictory to the bovine cow, where the teats can be very hard and firm due to the presence of milk in the teat cistern.\n",
				"H:Physiology of milking",
				"For a comparison with cattle see booklet on Efficient Milking. Buffaloes are said to be slow and hard milkers because of their slow milk ejection reflex and their hard teat muscle sphincter. The milk ejection reflex appears to be inherited to some extent but it is also a product of the environment. In buffaloes, the let down time averages 2 minutes but may be as long as 10 minutes. The reasons for this are not fully understood.\n\nOne reason for the longer let down time of milk for buffaloes is probably the different anatomy of the udder as compared to the dairy cow. In the buffalo, the udder cistern is absent or has a very small volume and therefore there is little or no cisternal milk available. This furthermore leads to no intra-mammary pressure in the cistern which would otherwise help the milk flow. In cattle, the milk is already stored in the large cistern, and milk is available for extraction immediately after preparation. The high intra-mammary pressure contributes in pressing out the milk.\n\nThe intra-mammary pressure increases at the onset of milking. It is highest during the peak flow and decreases there after to zero at the end of milking. The pressure is higher in buffaloes during milking than in cattle. The intra-mammary pressure varies between individuals and milkings. Its’ level is not always indicative of a high milk production.\n\nLet down time seems to be negatively correlated to milk yield. Let down time is shorter in early and middle stage of lactation as compared to in late lactation. A faster flow of milk is observed when the yield is higher. If buffaloes are carefully selected for yield and ease to milk, improvement in these characteristics is possible.",
				"H:Induction of milk let down:",
				"Physical stimulation of the teats, either by the calf’s suckling or the milkers hands, excite receptors from which nerve impulses are sending to the posterior pituitary gland causing secretion of the hormone oxytocin. The hormone is transported via the blood to the mammary gland. Because both hormones and nerve impulses are involved in the milk ejection reflex, it is called a neurohormonal reflex. Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of the alveoli and small ducts thereby emptying the milk into the larger ducts and the cistern. Hereafter the milk can be evacuated from the udder. See booklet on Efficient Milking.\n\nThe contraction of the alveoli may, to some extent, be enhanced by tactile stimuli of the udder (massaging, squeezing) the so called tap reflex. When calves suckle, they butt at the udder in order increase milk secretion. Manual massage of the udder during milking imitates this reflex.\n\nLike cattle, buffaloes can get used to different stimuli. It is clear that also in buffaloes, oxytocin release is triggered by visual or audible stimuli, such as the sight of the milker, the noise of the vacuum pump or when entering the milking parlour. The animal becomes conditioned to let-down milk and has thus developed a conditioned reflex. (An unconditioned reflex is the suckling of the calf.) By letting the animals get accustomed to a strict routine, time of let-down is shortened. In cattle, it has been demonstrated that feeding concentrate during milking improves time of let-down. It has yet to be shown in buffaloes.\n",
				"H:Inhibition of milk let down",
				"Buffaloes are sensitive to changes in the environment. They may withhold the milk if they are uncomfortable with the situation. If the animals are stressed, scared or in pain, the hormone adrenaline is secreted. This hormone causes constriction of the blood vessels, thereby hindering the supply of sufficient amount of oxytocin to the udder. Adrenaline also directly acts on the myoepithelial cells in the alveoli by blocking the oxytocin receptors. The inhibition if milk let-down will result in the leaving of milk in the secretory parts of the udder. Continuos exposure of stress to the buffaloes will affect the milk production negatively. Change of milker or milking routine, application of wrong milking technique or milking machines in bad conditions are some reasons for the buffaloes to with hold the milk.\n",
				"H:Evacuation of the milk",
				"The actual milking can begin after the let down reflex has been elicited. Whether this is done by hand or machine it is important to use proper routines. The milking should be done as fast as possible without causing stress or pain. The milking should be as complete as possible without excessive stripping. Elevated residual milk in the secretory part of the udder decreases milk secretion and thereby influences the milk yield negatively.\n",
				"H:Keeping good hygiene",
				"Simple guidelines for keeping good hygiene in the barn or milking parlor:\nDung should be removed both prior to and during milking in order to minimize exposure of the milking equipment to dirt. If the equipment for some reason becomes dirty, it must be cleaned properly before using it again.\n\nHands should be clean when milking or handling the milk. Clothes should be clean.\nUse one udder-towel per buffalo, discharge towels in a separate bucket after usage.\nPost-dipping of teats should always be done.\nAll containers with milk should have a lid on at all times.\n",
				"Milk should not be stored near the dung or feeding place. There are several reasons for this; 1) milk is sensitive to odors and may  ”pickup” dung or feed odors. 2) Bacteria from dung or feed are more easily transferred to the milk if it is stored nearby. 3) Particles from the dung heap or the feed may contaminate the milk.\nIt should not be possible for animals such as dogs, cats and rats to approach the containers.\n\n",
				"H:Pre-milking",
				"Pre-milking is defined as actions to induce milk let-down by cleaning the udder and pre-milk in a strip cup. Cleaning the udder should be done with a lubricated towel (washable textile or disposable paper). Separate towels should be used for each buffalo. The udder should never be splashed with water.\n\nPre-milking is necessary for various reasons; the most important being preparing the buffalo for actual milking and checking for mastitis or other infections. Pre-milking must be done in a strip cup, never on the floor! The purpose of using a strip cup is to be able to easily observe changes in the milk. Furthermore, the spreading of pathogenic bacteria is limited. Pre-milking is done with dry hands and the full hand method. The hands should be cleaned between buffaloes during the milking, if necessary.\n",
				"H:After milking",
				"After milking the teats should be disinfected. This reduces, if not completely inhibits, bacterial growth on the teats. The teat canal stays open for a while after milking is completed, thus eliminating the important protection against entry of bacteria. The dip solution will both act as a physical hindrance for bacteria and as a disinfectant. Preferably the teat-dipping-solution should contain some lubricant in order to maintain teat condition and to prevent chapping and sores.\n\nBecause the teat canal is open after milking, sometimes for as long as half an hour, the buffaloes should be prevented from lying down. This can be done by giving enough feed to last for a long time after milking.\n\nSpecial detergents for cleaning of the milking equipment is available and should be used correctly. All buckets, containers and machines used for milking must be cleaned both outwards and inwards immediately after usage.\n\nThe towels used for cleaning and drying of the udder should be cleaned properly after each milking. They can be stored in a bucket with a lid and clean water containing chloride until the next milking.\n",
				"H:Milking routine",
				"An appropriate milking routine is important for hygienic and production reasons as well as for creating a comfortable and smooth environment for animals and milkers. It is easier to maintain a good hygiene and to facilitate the adoption by the buffaloes to relief milkers if a consistent milking routine is applied. In dairy cows it has been demonstrated that the practicing of a strict milking routine results in increased milk production.\n\nThe routine mentioned below can be followed by both hand and machine milkers in tie-stall barns and where milking are carried out in flat barns. In the case of hand milking in such barns, points 6 to 9 are omitted. Routine check of the milking machine should be done before each milking session according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.\n\nStart by tying (if not already tied) and feeding the buffaloes.\n",

				"Wash hands with soap and dry them.\n",
				"Clean the teats with special towels and massage them thoroughly.\n",
				"Foremilk the buffalo by hand in a strip cup, checking the appearance of the milk.\n",
				"Apply the cluster gently. Check tube alignment.\nCheck the buffalo every now and then to make sure that she is comfortable with the machine.\n",
				"Palpate the udder to check that it feels empty.\n",
				"Remove the cluster gently.\n",
				"Dip the teats in a suitable disinfectant solution.\n",
				"Clean all the equipment in the milking room.\n",
				"When machine milking, it is important that the milking machine is nearby and ready to be applied to the udder at the right time (after pre-milking). ",
				"Thus, each buffalo must be cleaned, massaged and pre-milked and then have the machine applied directly. It must be emphasized that it is not possible to clean all the buffaloes first and then apply the machines to the first buffaloes. ",
				"The oxytoxcin release has a short duration (a few minutes). If the machine does not start milking after this time, a whole new procedure must start after half an hour.\n",
				"H:Hand milking:",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_milking_machine.png",
				"\n\nPre-milking routines are as important when milking buffaloes as when milking cows. For a complete review see Efficient Milking. It is important to use a smooth and comfortable milking technique. The ”knuckling” or ”stripping” method is used in the wrong belief that it is necessary in order to overcome the resistance in the teat sphincter. These milking methods might cause elongation and damage to the teats. A much more comfortable and appropriate method is the”fullhand” technique.\n",
				"H:Machines for milking buffaloes",
				"Since the udder and teats in buffaloes are different compared to cattle, milking machines for cattle have to be modified in order to fit buffaloes. In general, a heavier cluster, a higher operation vacuum and a faster pulsation rate is required. Results from recent studies in India indicate that it might be possible to reduce the cluster weight and the frequency of liner slip by applying an appropriate combination of liner design and cluster weight.\n\nIt is not only the total weight of the cluster that is important, but also the distribution of its weight on the udder. Unequal weight distribution can cause uneven milk output. The long milk and vacuum tubes should be aligned and stretched to ensure equal weight distribution of the cluster on the udder.\n\nMilking characteristics depend upon vacuum levels and pulsation rates among others. Studies on Egyptian buffaloes revealed that a vacuum of 51 kPa and a pulsation rate of 55 cycles/min led to much longer milking times than a vacuum of 60 kPa and a pulsation rate of 65 cycles/min (6.21 min. compared to 3.18 min.). The higher vacuum level, however, caused a significant increase in the somatic cell counts. Highest milk yield within an acceptable time were found when using 56 kPa and 65 cycles /min. In all trials a pulsation ratio of 50:50 was used. Studies in Pakistan indicated that the pulsation rate and ration should be 70 cycles/min and 65:35 respectively for Nili-Ravi buffaloes.\n\nIn Italy, the majority of farms use the same machines for both buffaloes and cattle. It is a simple ”cattle machine” with one vacuum level operating at approximately 40 cm Hg. In India, recent trials have been made with milking with Duovac TM from Alfa Laval Agri. Successful milking was done with a vacuum level of 55 kPa, 70 cycles/min pulsation rate and pulsation ratio of 65:35 for milk flows above 0.2 kg/min. For milk flows under 0.2 kg/min the respective data where 38 kPa, 48 cycles/min and the same pulsation ratio. The Duovac TM is physiologically correct for the animal since it helps in gently stimulating let-down and is also gentler to the teats after the peak flow.\n\nMilking with machines\n\nIn order to obtain all the advantages with machine milking the correct technique must be used. The milkers and buffaloes must be familiar with the machines. If the buffaloes are scared or feel uncomfortable they will withhold the milk and thereby yield less. This in turn will lead to economic loss for the farmer and eventually he will loose his faith in machine milking.\n\n\n",
				"H:Introducing machine milking",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/buffalo_milkman.png",
				"\n\nThe concept of machine milking should be introduced slowly and by persons who the buffaloes are used to and feel comfortable with under the supervision of an expert from Alfa Laval Algri.\n\nThe procedure of introducing buffaloes to machine milking presented below an recommended by Alfa Laval Agri is applicable for a whole herd where neither animals nor humans are familiar with machine milking. By carefully following the mentioned steps, a successful introduction should be possible.\n\nTraining of personnel. Training of milkers should be done by a person from the milking machine company. This person has good knowledge about biology of milking, machine milking as well as with the design, function and maintenance of the milking equipment. The training should include introduction procedures, milking routine, handling of the machine, cleaning and maintenance as well as certain aspects of the day-to-day service of the machine.\nInstallation of the milking machine in the barn and any other modification in the barn should be made well in advance of the changing to machine milking.\nIt is most appropriate to start with heifers since it is easier to habituate heifers than older buffaloes to machine milking. Older buffaloes may have been hand milked by a certain routine for several lactations and may respond negatively to a change in routine. Heifers on the other hand are not accustomed to any specific routine and are more likely to accept machine milking as well as hand milking. Furthermore their udders and teats are more uniform and not damaged by previous milking. Liner slip and other negative effects of machine milking is therefore less pronounced in heifers. Note that heifers should not be hand milked but directly introduced to the machine. They may get accustomed to the noise of the vacuum pump etc. by participating in the milking routines prior to partus.\nCalm animals that are comfortable with hand milking should be selected. The udders and teats of the animals should be uniform with respect to conformation and size. Buffaloes in heat or unhealthy animals or animals with previous let-down-problems should not be selected.\nMilk the old and selected animals as usual by hand but let the vacuum pump run during milking. This will make the animals accustomed to the noise. Put the pump on before actual milking, but after the buffaloes have been tied up, otherwise the animals may be startled by the sudden noise. Repeat the procedure (usually 2 to 4 times) until all buffaloes are accustomed to the noise. It is better to repeat this procedure once or twice more until all buffaloes are comfortable, than rushing into the next step.\nBring the milking machines into the barn. Connect them to the airline and place them at each buffalo’s place at the same time as hand milking is carried out. This will allow the buffaloes to get used to the ”ticking” sound of the pulsator. It will give them a chance to look at the machines and smell them and may be even taste them. Make sure though, that they do not chew on them! Move the machines to the next buffalo in order to milked. This makes the buffaloes used to machines being moved around. The procedure should be repeated (usually 2 to 4 times) until all the animals have accepted the presence of the machines.\n",
				"At this stage, presumably all buffaloes will be well accustomed to the new routine. If some buffaloes are still showing signs of nervousness or stress, it is recommended to repeat the above mentioned steps until the animals are calm. Buffaloes that after this procedure have not accepted being milked by machines should be returned to hand milking. One or two frightened or uncomfortable buffaloes might cause major disturbances in the whole herd.\n\nConsistency with respect to milking routine including pre-milking preparation should be applied from the beginning of the introduction period. The regular milker should carry out the machine milking during the introduction period.\n\nWhen the cluster is firmly attached to the udder, the milker should stay with the buffalo to see that she is comfortable. Soft talking and brushing and scratching are the best ways to calm an animal. These first sessions of machine milking usually require longer time than the following. However, this time is well worth spending to assure forward calm and easy-milking buffaloes.\n"

				"Flushing will have effect only if the ewes were in declining phase of nutritional availability. ",
				"Ewes in better body condition will produce more lambs and thus the flushing of leaner ewes will increase the fertility by way of increased incidence of oestrus and increased ovulation rate. ",
				"To obtain increased lambing rate, the breeding ewes, 4-6 weeks prior to their being bred, should be supplemented with 250g of concentrate mixture or 500 g of good quality legume hay per head per day.\n",
				"H:Pregnant Ewes",
				"The foetus makes two-thirds of its total growth during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy. ",
				" The consequences of under-nutrition in late pregnancy are reduction in lamb’s birth weight, poor milk production and poor lamb survival. ",
				" Under-nutrition may also result in occurrence of pregnancy toxaemia which results in collapse and possible death of the ewes. ",
				" There is production of ketone and acetone bodies in the blood from the rapid breakdown of body fat to meet the energy requirements of advanced pregnancy. ",
				" Thus, the amount of nutrients, especially energy, must be increased during the later part of pregnancy to ensure proper growth of foetus and high milk production.\n",
				"H:Lactating Ewes",
				"The requirements of energy and protein are higher during lactation. During early lactation sufficient quantity of good quality grazing and supplementary concentrate or legume hay or dry tree leaves should be provided as the demand for energy in lactation is very high.",
				"  The lactation ewes require concentrate supplementation on even higher rate than the advanced pregnancy. ",
				" Lactation also causes to mobilize body reserves of fat which is replaced with water. They should also be fed a high level of energy in early lactation. ",
				"A high protein diet improves the yield of milk but at the cost of the body reserves and hence both energy and protein should be balanced in the diet of lactation sheep.",

				" It will require some personal attention and training the lambs to suckle goats. ",
				" Artificial feeding of milk using glass bottles with rubber nipples can be adopted, but hygienic measures must be adhered to. ",
				" Lambs should be started on creep feed as soon as possible after birth.  The consumption is negligible during first 2-3 weeks but will increase with age and weight. ",
				" The creep ration (feed for young ones) should be highly palatable and rich in protein. ",
				" Feeding of weaned lambs involves a balance between the use of cereals and the forages rich in energy and protein to achieve economic growth. ",

				"H:Water",
				"Water, though not considered a nutrient, is essential for proper functioning of the body as it is more vital for the maintenance of the animal life than any other feed component. ",
				" It is the main constituent of all body tissues and helps in the excretion of waste products through faeces and urine.",
				"  The body water plays and important role in the animal’s thermoregulatory mechanism.  ",
				"Most of the water requirement is usually satisfied by the water in the feed when green feed is available. ",
				" Water intake in highly correlated with both air temperature and absolute humidity. ",
				" Water requirement increases during growth, gestation, lactation and heat stress when salt content of the diet is more, or when animals are made to travel long distances. ",
				" On dry feed, an adult sheep requires about 2 liters of water per day during winter and 3.5-4 litres during summer. ",
				" Normally a sheep will drink approximately 2-3 litres of water for every 1 kg of dry, feed consumed.  Sheep in desert areas can stand water deprivation up to 3 days. ",
				" Watering free choice on alternative days has no deleterious effect.  Sheep can tolerate salt content up to 1 per cent in the drinking water.\n",
				"H:ENERGY",
				"The soluble carbohydrates, fibre, fats and oils are the sources of energy. ",
				" Such energy is used to produce heat to keep the body warm and to keep it cool through evapo-transpiration, and provide energy for physical activities and other life processes. ",
				" The carbohydrates are also required for the growth and development of rumen micro-organisms.  In their body weight both under stall feeding and grazing conditions. ",
				" Lambs achieve satisfactory growth rate at a dry-matter intake level of 4 to 5 per cent of body weight. ",
				" Different systems are in vogue all over the world to express the energy requirements.  In India the digestible nutrients (TDN) system is in practice. ",
				" In recent times metabolizable energy (ME) system is also being followed.  The TDN requirement of lambs is higher than that of adult sheep. ",
				" Similarly the pregnant, lactating and breeding ewes require more energy than the non-pregnant, non-lactating ones. ",
				" As a thumb rule a non-pregnant, non-lactating ewe requires 10 g of TDN per kg live weight for maintenance and wool production. ",
				" This requirement would be about 50 per cent more during last 6 weeks of pregnancy and 100 per cent more during the first 10 weeks of lactation. ",
				" The energy deficiency may result in reproductive failure, poor growth and loss in body weight and may ultimately lead to death.  ",
				"The dry matter should contain about 50-55 per cent TDN for adults and 60-65 per cent TDN for growing lambs.\n",
				"H:PROTEIN",
				"Protein is the basic structural material of all the body tissues and is constantly required for the regeneration of all the living tissues which are undergoing constant wear and tear. ",
				" The breeding animals need protein for prenatal growth, development of the foetus and to produce milk for post-natal growth of young ones. ",
				" Clean soured wool or keratin is almost a pure protein.  If the ration does not contain enough energy, the protein will be used as energy source.",
				"  But protein cannot be replaced by any other nutrient in the ration.  Protein deficiency causes reduced feed intake and poor feed efficiency.",
				"  This would result in poor growth and development of muscle, reduced reproductive efficiency and wool production. ",
				" The protein-deficient animals have lower disease resistance due to smaller amount of immune protein.\n",
				"H:MINERALS",
				"Minerals are required for the building and maintenance of the skeleton and teeth.  ",
				"They play an important role in digestion, in the maintenance of osmotic pressure in different body fluids and wool growth. ",
				" Deficiency of any mineral will exhibit clinical symptoms.  The role of the minerals in sheep nutrition is complicated. ",
				" Excess of some of them may result in poor feed intake, digestion and utilization of other minerals, and can even cause toxicity. ",
				" The common mineral deficiency symptoms are anorexia (reduced appetite), reduced gain or loss in body weight, unthriftiness, abnormal hair or wool coat and skin dullness, bone deformation, staggered gait and organ damage. ",
				" Calcium and phosphorus are necessary for bone formation and its maintenance.  Deficiencies or imbalance of these minerals are indicted by rickets in young ones and osteoporosis in adults.  Deficiency of copper and cobalt may result in tetany and doggy wool. ",
				" Selenium deficiency may lead to ‘white muscle’ disease in lambs.  Sulphur is present in wool and hair and its deficiency will lead to poor wool production and quality.  Inadequate supply of iron, copper and cobalt results in anaemia, and lack of iodine in goiter.\n",
				"H:VITAMINS",
				"Vitamins are metabolically essential.  In sheep some vitamins are synthesized in their tissues and some by micro-organisms in their gastro-intestinal tract. ",
				" The symptoms of vitamin deficiencies are anorexia, reduced growth, dermatitis, weakness and staggering gait.  In sheep vitamin A is more important and its deficiency can cause various kinds of blindness.\n",

It helps to remove undesirable animals and breeding from those which are most approximating the ideal sheep.  About 10-20 per cent culling should be practiced annually to develop a good flock.  The flock size should be maintained by replacing culled ewes by ewe lambs born in the flock.\n",

Metal or plastic ear-tags with stamped letters and numbers are most suitable although they are relatively expensive and heavy for the ears of the smaller native sheep.",
				"  These ears tags are applied with the help of a clincher.\n",
				"H:Castration",
				"\nSurplus males are castrated to check indiscriminate mating but market demand most often favours the intact male.  Castration is usually done by using knife, burdizzo castrator or elastrator. ",

				"H:Symptoms",
				"The incubation period is generally 1-2 weeks but it may be as short as 3 days. Tetanus affects many species of domesticated animals but occurs particularly in horses and lambs; less frequently in adult sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dog and cats; and rarely in poultry.The initial symptoms are mild stiffness and an unwillingness to move all the animals.

				"H:Symptoms",
				"In farm animals the disease occurs towards the end of winter or early spring. The first signs of meningo- encephalitis are stiffness of neck, inco-ordinated movement of limbs and tendency to move in circles or to lean against a fence or wall. There may be paralysis of muscles of jaw and pharynx. Inco-ordination becomes progressively more severe until the animal can no longer stand. The cattle which are not severely affected may survive. Abortions in cattle usually  occur after 4-8 months of pregnancy and at a comparatively later stage in sheep. In pigs and horses, clinical signs are not common but may develop as encephalitis and septicaemia. In poultry, the disease usually causes sudden death, occasionally there are signs of torticollis, weakness and inco-ordination of the legs.\n",

The incubation period extends from 12 months to several years. The animal aged 3 to 6 years mostly suffer from the disease. Affected animals may not show clinical symptoms continue to discharge organisms in faeces. The organisms persist in pastures for about 1 year.The organisms are susceptible to sunlight, drying and high PH of soil; continuous contact of urine with faeces reduces the life of bacteria. In cattle clinical signs appear mainly during 2-6 years of age. The infected animals which are apparently healthy, often show clinical signs after parturition.\n",

Tail docking and castration may also be done in first week or so by placing elastrator (strong rubber band) at the intervertebral space and not on the vertebra.\nAlternatively use sterilized and clean knife for castration and docking and resort to proper ligation and antiseptic dressing at the roof of scrotum with testicles before it.\nDuring castration keep the lambs on perfectly dry, clean and hygienic site so as to minimize the risks of losses from tetanus.\nWeaning and Care of Weaners\nThe management of weaners plays an important part in good sheep husbandry. The following steps are important in proper care and management of weaners.\n\nWeaning should preferably be done at 90 days, although in breeds with low milk production or where re-breeding is desired it can be done around 60 days.\nSupplementary feeding and good clean pastures for growing weaners should be provided.\nWeaned lambs should be drenched against gastro-intestinal parasites by first month; and vaccinated against enterotoxaemia and sheep-pox.\nWeaners should not be grazed on poor burry and thorny types of pasture since it could cause skin irritation, injury to the eyes and damage to wool.\nThey should be protected against vagaries of climates and predation.\n",

				" Twinning is very common and triplets and quadruplets are rare.",
				"In drought prone areas risk of goat farming is very much less as compared to other livestock species.",
				"Goats are ideal for mixed species grazing. The animal can thrive well on wide variety of thorny bushes, weeds, crop residues, and agricultural by-products unsuitable for human consumption.",
				"The goat meat is more lean (low cholesterol) and relatively good for people who prefer low energy diet especially in summer and sometimes goat meat (chevon) is preferred over mutton because of its \"chewability\".\n",
				"Goat milk is easy to digest than cow milk because of small fat globules and is naturally homogenized. Goat milk is said to play a role in improving appetite and digestive efficiency.

				"H:'Lean-to' Type Shed:",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_house_leantype.png",
				"\nThe cheapest form of building is the 'lean-to' type shed located against the side of an existing building. Such a shed for a family of two goats should be 1·5 m wide and 3·0 m long. This length provides 0.3 m for the manger and 1·2 m for the goats; the remaining 1·5 m space is sufficient for two milking does with a stub wall between them. The height nearest the wall should be 2·3 m and on the lower side 1·7 m giving a slope of 0·6 11) to the roof, which may be tiled or thatched. An open-framed window of good size on the lower side and an open-\u00ADframed door should be provided. Arrangements for storing hay or dried feed can be made overhead.\n\nThe plan for a house varies with the climatic conditions and the type of flock to be sheltered. In dry climates with a rainfall of 50 to 75 cm a long shed open on the sides, little exposed to weather and built on well \u00ADdrained ground makes an excellent shelter.\nA goat, when reared singly, can be housed in any building provided it is dry, free from draft and well ventilated. The space allowed should be 1·8 m x 1·8 m. A plain board, 28 cm wide and 2·5 cm thick with two circular holes sufficiently large for receiving two small galvanized iron pails, may be used in place of the manger or a trough for food. It should be raised 50 to 60 cm from the floor, supported on wooden or iron brackets fixed to the wall. These pails, one for water and the other for food, are preferred to the manger, as the accumulated residue of feed can be easily removed from them.\nIn the tropics because of high temperature, heavy rainfall and the susceptibility of goats-to parasitism, the most practical goat houses are those which are raised above the ground level, are well ventilated, and have long eaves to prevent heavy rain showers to splash in from the sides. The floor must be strong (wooden strips with small slits in between) and the roof material should provide effective insulation from the solar radiation. The roofing material would be made of bamboo or tree leaves or earthen tiles which are cheap and practical. Provision must be made for collection of dung and urine periodically.",
				"H:\nShelter for Buck",

				"An enclosure measuring I2 m x 18 m is adequate for 100 to 125 goats. Such an enclosure or exercise paddock should be well fenced with strong woven wires which should not be far apart near the bottom. The exercise paddocks should be made bigger than the enclosures and should have some shade trees if the stock is to be maintained constantly in confinement. An extra-strong woven wire should be used, as goats have the habit of climbing fences and also of rubbing their bodies against them. Barbed wire should not be used so as to avoid injury to the udder and teats.

Each stall as well as the yard should have a' separate watering arrangement.\n",
				"H:Hay Racks",
				"Goats are very wasteful and refuse to eat what has dropped down on the ground. Hay racks are very helpful for feeding. The bars of hay racks should not be more than 5 cm apart and there should be a wooden board, fixed about 15 cm below the rack, to catch what falls from the rack while the goat is feeding.",

				"The animal is provided with a shelter with in its reach so that it may turn to it in the event of extreme heat or heavy rains. Goats have strong dislike for rain and for getting wet. The shelter should be temporary and preferably a portable one. The rope or chain used for tethering should be about 35 to 50cm long. The peg should be tethered only in the morning and evening, and kept in the shed during the mid-day.

				"Goats do not relish hay prepared from forest grasses, even if cut in early stages, but very much relish hay prepared from leguminous crops: Some of the common green roughages liked by the goats are: lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum Juslen.), Napier grass (Penniselum purpureum Schum.), green arhar (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), cowpea (Vigna sinensis (L.) Savi ex Hassk.), soybean (GIyCiflemax-(L.) Merr.) , cabbage and cauliflowerleaves;shajtal. senji. methi; shrubs and weeds of different kinds; and leaves of trees such as babul (Acacia arabica WilJd), neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.), ber (Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk.), tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) andpipa/ (Ficus re/igiosa L.). The common dry fodders liked by goats are straws of arhar. urid (Phaseolus mungo Roxb.), mung (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.), gram (Cicer arietinum L.), dry leaves of trees, and lucerne or berseem hays. The last two are popular and constitute the main forage crops for milch goats.",

				"H:Nutrients Required",
				"The nutrients needed may be divided into maintenance, production (for milk, meat and hair production) and pregnancy requirements.\n",
				"H:Maintenance ration:",
				"The maintenance requirements are related to surface area and basal metabolic rate. Goats have higher basal metabolic\n",
				"H:rate than cattle",
				"therefore, their maintenance requirements are higher than those of cattle. The requirement by weight is calculated and an additional feed of about 25 to 30 per cent for maintenance is allowed. The maintenance requirement thus calculated is 0·09 per cent digestible crude protein (DCP) and 0·09 per cent total digestible nutrients (TDN). It will be desirable to point out one interesting aspect. For its size the goat can consume substantially more feed than cattle or sheep, viz. 6·5 to 11 per cent of its body weight in dry matter when compared with 2·5 to 3 per cent for cattle or sheep. This means that the goat can satisfy its maintenance requirement and produce milk from forage alone.\n",
				"H:Production ration:",
				"Requirements for the production of 1 litre of milk with 3·0 per cent fat is 43 g of DCP and 200 g of starch equivalent (SE), whereas for the production of 1 litre of milk with 4·5 per cent fat it is 60 g of DCP and 285 g of SE.\nThe nutritional requirements of a goat weighing 50 kg and yielding 2 litres of milk with 4 per cent fat may be met by feeding 400 g of concentrate mixture and 5 kg of Berseem or Lucerne. The ration should have 12 to 15 per cent protein content, depending on the amount of protein in their hay and in the milk produced.\n",
				"H:Mineral mixture:",
				"Minerals should be given as an essential part of the ration as they contribute to the building of the skeleton, physiological functions and production of milk. The more important of these salts are calcium and phosphorus. The requirements of calcium and phosphorus for maintenance are 6·5 and 3·5 g, respectively, per 50 kg body weight. Goats require slightly larger quantities of calcium than sheep. The mineral mixture may be included in the concentrate ration at the rate of 0·2 per cent.\n",
				"H:Common salt:",
				"Lumps of rock salt are just the' thing for them. These lumps of salt, of fairly good size, should be hung up in some suitable place where goats can easily get at them, or else they may be kept in the manger. The provision of salt licks is very important for goats as they secrete a good amount of sodium and chloride ions in milk. The salt often helps to tone up the system and may even have some effect in removing worms from the body. Salt to the extent of 2 percent may also be mixed with the daily grain ration of goats.\n",
				"H:Vitamins and antibiotics:",
				"Goats need particularly vitamins A, D and E. The microbes in the rumen synthesize most of the other needed vitamins. Vitamin A can be supplied by feeding green forage and yellow maize. One kg of lush-green fodder will provide. Synthetic vitamins A and D may be included in the ration of growing kids.\nFeeding of aureomycin or terramycin increase the growth rate of young kids, reduces the incidence of scours and other infectious diseases and improves the general appearance of the kids.\n\n"

			"Management practices": [
				"T:Determination of Age",
				"The age of a goat judged from its front teeth (incisors) on the lower jaw. There are no teeth on the upper jaw. The kid at birth, or shortly afterwards, has teeth on the lower jaw. ",
				"These are known as suckling teeth. They are small and sharp in kids.",
				" When the kid is 12 to 14 months old the central pair is shed and is replaced by two large permanent teeth; when 24 to 26 months old two more small teeth are shed and are replaced by two large teeth, one on each side of the first pair; when 36 to 38 months old there are six permanent teeth, and when 48 to 50 months old a complete set of four pairs of permanent teeth are present.",
				" Occasionally teeth develop much more quickly and the goat may have all its permanent teeth by the time it is three years old. Once all the permanent teeth have developed the degree of wear and tear gives a rough indication of age. The teeth start wearing four to six weeks after eruption. Wearing of teeth depends upon the type of feed and care given to the animals. ",
				"Some may-mature early and others late. Age of eruption of teeth serves as a reasonable and dependable guide for judging maturity",
				"H:\n\nIdentification",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_tagging.png",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_tags.png",
				"Each goat in a herd should be marked in the same manner by using some identification mark such as tattooing, metal ear-tags or notching of the ears. The tattooing system is used almost universally.\n\n",
				"H:Disbudding and Dehorning",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_disbudding.png",
				"This should be done when the male kid is two to five days old and the female kid is up to 12 days old. The hair should be clipped from around the horn-bud, and this area covered with petroleum jelly to protect it from caustic soda or potash, which should be thoroughly rubbed on the bud until the horn-bud is well blistered. ",
				"Caustic soda should not come into contact with the eyes. An electric de homer can also be used safely. 'The kid should be muzzled gently so that it can breathe freely; otherwise partial suffocation may occur. Mature goats can be dehorned by sawing off the horns close to the head with a meat saw. ",
				"This should be done in winter when flies are not troublesome. The wound should be dressed.\n\n",
				"H:Castration",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_castration.png",
				"Male goats are raised mainly for meat and not for breeding. For this reason males are castrated with an emasculator, or torsion forceps. The best time for castrating bucks is when they are six months old with the Burdizzo instrument. ",
				"This avoids all risks of infection. Castration improves the flesh of the adult buck.",
				" A castrated male is' called a wether.\n\n",
				"H:Exercise",
				"The goats require exercise for maintaining themselves in a good condition. Stock on range receive sufficient exercise while grazing. Stall-fed goats should be let loose in a large paddock for at least three to four hours a day. ",
				"The bigger the paddock, the better they enjoy. Goats should not be let loose in the paddock or sent out for grazing until the dew has dried up, i.e. not until one to two hours after sunrise. Grazing on wet grass with dew is likely to result in tympanites and intestinal inflammation.\n\n",
				"H:Hoof Trimming",
				"Hoof trimming is necessary for the well-being of goats. If neglected it can weaken legs, ruin feet and lower milk production. The goats soon become used to trimming as a monthly routine. Sharp pen-knives or curved hand-pruning shears can be used effectively.\n\n",
				"H:Selecting the Doe \n",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_doe.png",
				"An outstanding doe is the nucleus of a productive herd. Selection of a doe should be made with great care. ",
				"Good body development is essential for high milk production. The doe should be well grown, healthy in appearance, and stand squarely on her feet and not down on the pastern. ",
				"The body should be wedge-shaped and sharp at the withers. The depth of the ribs denotes capacity for consuming large amounts of food. ",
				"The thighs should provide plenty of room for a round, well \u00ADattached udder of fair size.\n\n",
				"The skin should be loose, pliable and free from dryness. Poor condition of flesh may be an indication of a good milker, while a poor milker may be in good flesh.",
				" The neck should be thin and the head narrow. The eyes should be clear and bright. Does should be truly feminine in appearance and mild in temperament. It is difficult to handle, milk, feed and manage nervous goats.",
				" The milk potential cannot be estimated from the size of the udder. The udder of a good milch goat should be soft and pliable rather than meaty. The teats should be pointed slightly forward. The udder in a freshly milked goat should have a collapsed appearance.\n\n",
				"H:\nSelecting the Buck\n",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_buck4.png",
				"The buck should have a strong, well-developed frame, and good conformation and breed characters. Good depth of ribs is essential. Legs should be straight and well placed under the body. The buck should be healthy and free from external and internal parasites.",
				" He should be chosen from a good milking strain and should be the progeny of dams having good performance record. Poor condition of flesh is not a serious drawback, since bucks usually worry a good deal, especially during the rutting season. Many herdsmen prefer the bucks to be hornless.",
				" A well \u00ADgrown buck kid maybe bred to 'five or six does during his first season at an approximate age of six months. When 18 to 24 months old he may be permitted to service 25 to 30 does, and when fully mature 50 to 60 does in a breeding season.\n\n",
				"H:Mating Season\n",
				"The does are more or less continuous breeders. The signs of heat in the doe usually are uneasiness, tail shaking, pink and swollen genitalia, frequent urination, restlessness, bleating and a little mucous discharge for one to three days. The period between heats varies from 18 to 21 days.",
				" It is better to inseminate the doe on the second day of the heat period. The sperms survive in the female genital tract for 22 to 42 hours. Mating should be so timed that the kids are born in a season when mortality among them is at its lowest and an adequate amount of food is available for their nourishment and growth.",
				" Breeding seasons will, therefore, vary with breed, locality and climate.\n\n",
				"H:Mating of the Doe",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_mating.png",
				"Does may be mated when 10 to 15 months old so that they kid at the age of 15 to 20 months.  But as a rule a goat should not be mated until it is one year old.",
				"The average gestation period is 151 ±3 days.  It is better to breed the female once a year.  Some goats can be made to kid twice in 18 months. ",
				"The goats reach their maximum efficiency at the age of five to seven years.  In exceptional cases they continue to be serviceable even up to 12 years and in rare cases up to 14 years.",
				"A well maintained doe may continue to be milked until a month before she is expected to kid again.  The condition of the doe during gestation will have a very great influence on the quality of kids at birth. ",
				" A doe in good condition will produce strong lively kids, whereas a doe in poor condition may produce ungainly kids, weak in constitution.  Does must be fed well, allowed liberal exercise and protected from rain and cold.\n\n",
				"H:Goats in Kid",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_pregnant_doe.png",
				"A temporary increase in milk yield after mating is considered to be an indication of pregnancy, but the first sign that a doe is in kid is the cessation of the Periodical return of oestrus.",
				"During the first three months of pregnancy there is little alteration in the shape of the in-kid does. The head of the kid can sometimes be felt from six to eight weeks. An old doe or a young doe which is to give birth to one kid may be very misleading in appearance and show no sign of pregnancy.",
				"Six to eight weeks before kidding, young does commence to show udder development, but this is by no means a sure sign of pregnancy as they will frequently show such development and even have milk in the udder when they are not in kid.\n\n",
				"An average goat can rear well two kids. Goats are known to give birth to as many as five kids at a time, but birth of such large numbers affects the health of the goat. The incidence of twinning varies with the breed, environment and number of kidding.",
				"The Beetal goats at Hisar Farm produced in a year, on an average, 35 per cent singlet, 54 per cent twins, 6·3 per .cent triplets and 0·4 per cent quadruplets. In Jamunapari the percentage of twinning varies from 19 to 50 with an average of 35, and in Barbari from 47 to 70.\n\n"

				"Sterility in males is a major cause as to why AI needs to be adopted and propagated in goats on a large scale. In Germany and the Netherlands the AI has been adopted on a large scale since 50's but it is also practiced in other countries.",
				" Normally a middle-aged buck donates 1 to 3 ml of semen, sometimes up to 5 ml. But semen quality is normally good when the volume is in 1 to 2 ml range. Semen is white to lemon-cream and varies in viscosity depending on concentration. Motility of good spermatozoa is greater than of bull spermatozoa, hence a different motility scoring pattern is recommended.",
				" The sperm count procedure is essentially the same. A minimum concentration of 2,000 x 106 spermatozoa per ml of ejaculate effects conception rate. Morphological defects are often seen with goat spermatozoa. Normally ejaculates with less than 10 per cent spermatozoa abnormality are capable of fertilization.\n",
				"Sterility due to semen stasis and hypoplasis of the gonads is as high as 25 per cent. This situation is more because of overfeeding than underfeeding. High temperature and humidity affect the semen quality in goat - bucks. The reaction time varies from 63 to 160 seconds and there is seasonally.",
				" Though Artificial Vagina method is widely used for semen collection, semen of good quality is obtainable through electric stimulation. Buck semen is very sensitive to cold shock. Yolk — citrate-based extenders are widely used to extend the semen to 1:10 and up to 1:15 also.",
				" Spermasol with yolk (1:6 dilution) and sulpha compounds for antibiotics are used to improve the keeping quality. Speculum is invariably in use for AI. The conception rate and the number of inseminations required vary from season to season. One to four inseminations are practised.",

				"Pregnant does need to continue as much normal activity as possible. They need the strength to carry the extra weight during the last two months and go through the labor successfully.  A doe should not come into pregnancy or the first two months too fat. The normal activity of walking around grazing should continue.\n",
				"H:Nutrition",
				"Nutrition is very important in the last two months of pregnancy. 70 % of the weight of the kid(s) is developed from around day 100 to the birthing date. Undernourishment during this period will result in the birth of smaller kids,  increased mortality and slower growth rates. A doe in late pregnancy has additional requirements from their supply of food, especially for energy foods. Also the uterus and its contents take up a large amount of space in the doe's abdomen so that she cannot eat enough poor-quality foodstuff to provide all of their requirements. The doe's body is designed to ensure that the kids get enough energy food at the expense of her own tissues. Her body will rob her own reserves to provide nutrition to the kids.",
				"A doe's appetite often drops off at this time and the volume of the uterus contents and the internal fat stored will limit the volume of feed she can consume. Therefore the quality of feed must be increased. High quality hay should be fed during this period. Goats that eat a lot of hay during pregnancy maintain that ability to ingest increased levels of roughage during lactation.",
				"Concentrate food with higher levels of protein can be fed to the does. You do not want to just feed higher levels of concentrate feed. High volumes  of concentrate feed has been associated with slow birthing and poor cervical dilations. We feed our pregnant does a concentrate feed with 16-17% protein level.

If we see the signs, we will be with them during the middle of the night.  Below is some of the type of signs to help you better understand when your doe is about to kid.\nCalendar - We do individual breeding of our does. They are placed with a specific buck when the doe comes into heat. We will leave the doe with the buck for two days and then remove them. We document the date the doe was serviced. From that date, we will start to closely watch the doe around 149 days from the breeding date.\n",
				"Tail Dropping - As the doe gets close to kidding time, her body will start to adjust to allow the pelvic bones to spread out. Look at the back bone of the goat as it connects to the tail area. Either side of the tail bone will indent showing the body is getting ready.",

				"- This is one of the better signs for estimating eminent labor. The top picture was taken 8 days prior to kidding and the bag looks full but the skin is not a shiny texture like the bottom picture. When the bag is strutted, the skin is as tight as it can get and the skin will be very shiny. The dirt on the bag in the bottom picture is not part of the strutted sign. That is coming from another sign, \"streaming\", which will be discussed later. The bottom picture was taken 2 hours before she went into labor.",
				" The bag changed from looking like the top picture to the bottom picture in about 3 hours. We have had a few does that did not have a strutted bag prior to kidding. The bag filled up after kidding, but that is not the norm. When we see the bag get strutted like the bottom picture, we expect labor to be very soon and will start to watch for three other signs...streaming, doe going off by herself, and soft talking by the doe.",
				"T:Streaming",
				" - This is an extension of the \"losing the plug\". The difference is in the amount of creamy mucus coming from the doe. This picture was taken at the same time as the \"bag strutting\" picture which was 2 hours before labor started. You can see the large amount of mucus streaming from the doe is what caused all of the muddy dirt on the bag. One hour earlier, there had been not streaming like this. It had looked similar to the \"losing the plug\" sign. When we see streaming like this, we expect the doe to start labor within 4-5 hours at least.",
				" We have seen does stream like this for several days and not go into labor and we get concerned when this occurs. Especially if the mucus changes to a strawberry color. That is normally a sign that something is wrong with the kids inside.",
				"I want to be alone - When we see a doe going off by herself, we get our kidding tools ready. We expect labor within 4-5 hours at least .Especially if we have seen strutting and streaming.\n",
				"Soft Talking - Another sure sign of eminent labor is when the doe starts baaing very soft. This is a different sound than she normally makes and much softer. She will also be looking back at her stomach quite often and can't find a comfortable place to stand or lay. We expect labor within 4-5 hours at least.\nPawing the ground - The doe will start pawing the ground like she is trying to clear a place for kidding.\n",

They may not be positioned properly or the cervix may not have expanded sufficiently to allow the kid to enter the birth cannel. It is likely that someone, (vet or you if you know what you are doing) may have to go inside to help. A vet may have to do a C-section to deliver the kids.",
				"If the streaming mucus is or turns strawberry red color, there may be problems with the kids.There are several does have this and the results ended up being the kids were already dead.\n\n",
				"T:Water Bubble",
				"One of the first activities of kidding can be a transparent bubble protruding that contains liquids. This does not always occur but is a normal process in the birthing. The doe will go into labor doing pushes and groaning. This transparent bubble will start to appear.\n",
				" She may get up and down during this period. Eventually it will burst and the doe will likely drink some of this liquid. A similar bubble may come out with the kid inside. If this is the bag with the kid inside, you will be able to see inside the bubble and one or more hooves or a nose will be seen.",
				"H:Potential problems",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_reproduction_potential_problem2.png",
				"Once this water breaks, you would like to see the doe proceed into heavy labor and showing signs of progressing to the next step within 2 hours. If several hours go by and either heavy pushing or signs of the kid appearing have not occurred, there may be problems. There are two possible problems:\n",
				"A dead baby - The doe may have a dead baby that is not pushing to get out and therefore the doe is not pushing.\n",
				"One or more babies are not positioned properly for birthing.\n",
				"In either situation, you may have to go inside the doe to try and help or get your vet involved. This was the situation with the doe in the picture to the right. This first water bubble occurred but no heavy labor occurred for the next 2.5 hours. At that time another water bubble appeared and then the doe went another hour without heavy labor. We contacted our vet and he suggested that there may be a dead kid and we should go inside to check and see if we could remove it. We proceeded to prepare for entry by using surgical gloves, disinfecting the gloves and the does vulva with Beta dine and applying OB lube to the hands.",
				" Entering her caused her to start pushing and we found a bag with a kid in it. We were able to pull the first kid and it was alive. We checked for others and  felt a foot that we gently pulled towards the outside. We could tell it was a rear leg. When we came to resistance, we felt around trying to find the other foot but found a head. We started working with the head and pulled another kid and it was alive. After that we pulled the third kid and it was alive also.",
				" We believe the second kid and third kid were blocking each other and until we started moving them around, they could not get positioned properly.

				"The first real sign we look for is some sign of a kid starting out the vulva. The picture to the bottom shows a single hoof starting to appear. If you look closely at the hoof, you will be able to tell if the kid will be coming out front first or rear first. If you see the top of the hoof, it is head first. If you see the bottom of the hoof, it is rear first.",

If she continues with no progress, someone (vet or you if knowledgeable)  will need to go inside to determine what is blocking the progress. It is likely that the kid is not positioned correctly as shown to the right.\n\n",
				"T:Two legs and a mouth",
				"\nThe picture in the down shows progress is being made and there are now two legs and notice that the tip of the mouth are at the exit. We noticed that both legs are front legs and the head is in position with the front legs to come out properly. As the head or nose starts to protrude, we watch closely to see if the kid has started to breathe on its own. If it has, we want to ensure that the nose area is cleared of anything that may not allow the kid to breathe. Sometimes we have a doe kidding and part of the head will start out and then as the doe moves around the head will go back in. We will watch closely for continued progress. Many times you will be able to see the kid's leg move around showing it is ok.\n",
				"H:Potential problems:",

				"Once we had two legs come out but one was a front leg and the other was a rear leg. It turned out that it was twins, with one coming head first and the other coming rear first. One leg was from one kid and the rear leg was from the other kid. We had to push the rear leg back in and feel around for the second front foot. We always wear elastic gloves for doing this and have some OB lubrication.\n",
				"Two front legs and no head. The head can be turned to the side and unable to come out. You need to try and correct the position of the head.\n\n",
				"T:Nearly Complete",
				"The hardest part seems to be getting the head to come out. After the head is out, the rest of the body should come out quickly. We step in to check the kid has nothing in the mouth area and clear anything away from the head. We will watch for breathing signs and look to ensure the nose area is clear. The kid may still be in the sack and we will step in to get the kid out of the sack and breathing.\n\n",

It turned out that the kid's shoulders were hunched forward and not positioned to go through the cervix area. He had to push the kid partially back in to position the shoulders correctly.\n\n",
				"T:Cleanup",
				"We make sure either the doe starts cleaning up the kid or we will lay the kid in front of the doe to allow her to start cleaning up. The doe will nibble at all of the mucus on the kid normally starting at the head. She needs to be able to clean up her kids in order to identify with the kid. Cleanup may be interrupted by going into labor again with more kids. We watch closely to ensure she does not lay on a kid already born while she tries to deliver other kids.",

There may be some wax in the tips that need to be removed to allow milk to flow.\nWe will monitor the kids while they try to nurse on their own for about 90 minutes. The faster they get their mother's colostrum, the better their future health will be.\nIf they have not nursed on their own in the 90 minute timeframe, we will try to help them nurse from their mother. We want the kids to nurse on their own if possible.\n",
				"If they cannot or will not nurse on their own within the 90 minutes, we will milk some colostrum into a glass jar and feed the kids with a bottle or drench with a syringe.\nOnce the kids have had some colostrum, we will give them 2cc of Bar Guard 99.\nAfter the kids have had colostrum and the Bar Guard 99, we will put them in a small doghouse type of  shelter in the pen with the mother. They can wander in and out but we want them to have some protection from their mother accidentally laying on them during the first 3 days.\n\n",
				"T:Shedding afterbirth",
				"The mother needs to shed the afterbirth within 24 hours of kidding. Most of the time, they shed it within hours. If there is some still hanging after 24 hours, you can try to \"gently\" pull it out. Some times the \"gravity\" has not taken effect and a gentle pull will remove the last of it. If you gently pull and it starts to come out without any \"resistance\", everything is ok. If not, you can give the doe some Oxytocin. This will help the doe shed the afterbirth and help bring in her milk.\n",
				"H:Exception:",
				"We use to think that after a doe shed her afterbirth, she will not have any more kids at that time. We had a doe give birth to a single and then shed her afterbirth four hours later. We expected twins and she still looked like she had another kid but there was no more labor. We checked on her eight hours later and nothing was happening so we assumed she was through. The next morning we found another kid dead in the pen. It was the same size and looked healthy. The vet said it can occur and the kid born after a doe loses her afterbirth is normally born dead.\n",
				"H:Goat nutrition",
				"Generally, goat feed nutrients are divided into six groups. Following is a brief discussion of these nutrients:\n",
				"H:Protein",
				"Protein is the only nutrient that contains nitrogen. Protein quality - a term referring to the amino acid content - has no significance in ruminant nutrition, except at exceptionally high levels of milk production. Rumen microorganisms manufacture their own body protein, consisting of all the necessary amino acids, which are later digested by the host animal.\n",
				"Protein makes up the basic animal tissue of the body and is vital for growth, milk production, disease resistance, reproduction, and general maintenance. The body has very little if any excess protein. Mostly, the nitrogen is eliminated by the kidneys and the rest is burned as energy. Since protein is generally the most expensive part of the ration, it is costly to feed more than what is needed. Protein requirements vary between 12 and 16 percent of the ration dry matter with the latter needed for high milk production.\n\n Urea and other non protein nitrogen products can be utilized by the microorganisms of the rumen for the production of protein. They are not generally recommended for goats because they are very selective in their diets.\n",
				"H:Energy",
				"All discussions of nutrition seem to begin with energy, probably because this is the best defined requirement  of farm animals and is expensive. Most of the goat's energy comes from the breakdown of the fiber of forages, while the remainder comes from the burning up of concentrate starches and fats. Over a longer period of time effects such as retarded growth, delayed puberty, and decreased fertility will become apparent.",
				"Energy is measured in two different ways by the feed industry. The first and more established method is by Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN). As the name suggests, the TDN consists of the sum of the digestible carbohydrates, digestible protein, and digestible fats (multiplied by 2.25 since fats contain that much more energy than protein or carbohydrates). The TDN system takes into consideration only one nutrient loss - feces. For this reason, the net energy system is gaining in popularity. This system considers energy that is lost in the feces, urine, gases, and the work of digestion. In recent years this system has been even more refined to account for varying energy utilization needs for body maintenance, weight gain, or milk production. \n",
				"H:Minerals",
				"Many minerals are required by the goat. Most can be obtained from good forage and a regular concentrate mixture. The major minerals of concern are calcium, phosphorus, and salt, which are usually added to the ration either in the grain mix or by free-choice feeding. Goats do not consume minerals free choice according to their needs. It is, therefore, recommended that minerals be force-fed through the grain mixture or mixed with a succulent feed like silage or green chop, if possible. The ratio of calcium to phosphorus is important and should be kept around 2:1. If these minerals must be fed free-choice, such as to dry goats and yearlings, a good mixture is one containing equal parts of salt and dicalcium phosphate, or a similar commercial mix.\n",
				"H:Vitamins",
				"Vitamins are needed by the body in small amounts. Since all the B vitamins and vitamin K are produced in the rumen and vitamin C is manufactured in the body tissues, the only vitamins of concern in ruminant nutrition are vitamins A, D, and E. During the late spring, summer, and early fall the animals can get all they need from green pastures and plenty of sunshine. In addition, they can store a good supply of these vitamins to carry them into the winter months.",
				"Nevertheless, it is a good idea to add these vitamins at the rate of 6 million units of vitamin A and 3 million units of vitamin D to each ton of grain mix during the winter months as an added precaution since they are not very expensive.\n",
				"H:Fats",
				"Fats are of little importance in the ruminant ration. Practically all feeds contain small amounts of fat, and added levels are not practical. A level of 1.5 - 2.5 percent in the grain mixture is normal.\n",
				"H:Water",
				"This is the least expensive feed ingredient, yet a deficiency will affect milk production more quickly than the lack of any other nutrient. Water is not only the largest single constituent of nearly all living plant and animal tissue, but it also performs exceedingly important functions during digestion, assimilation of nutrients, excretion of waste products, control of body temperature, and the production of milk. Ready access to water is important. Goats with water constantly available have been shown to produce more milk than those watered twice daily and over 10 percent more than those watered only once per day.\n\n"

			"Disease management": [
				"T:Disease management",
				"Generally goats are resistant to many diseases. However when we rear more number of animals in one place and insufficiency of pasture facilities, intensive system of rearing leads to spread of many diseases.",
				"This causes reduced production potential and more mortality which in turn causes economic losses to the farmers.",
				"Hence identification of diseases in goat and its prevention is most important.\n",
				"Health management is more important especially worm load. Hence the kids must be dewormed at first month of age and then once in a month upto 6 months of age. Ecoto-parasites must be treated carefully because it not only affect the growth and also affect skin quality.\n",

				"Separate infected animal from healthy one\nProvide proper quarantine measures while purchasing new animals.",
				"Proper disposal of dead animals.Rotational grazing to control infection\n\n",
				"T:BLOAT",
				"Bloat will be formed when animal consume young leaves and grasses, unknown weeds, easily digestible cereals, rotten vegetables and fruits.",
				"Bloat will be followed by diarrhoea, dysentery leads to decumbency and death. Administration of vegetable oil  (50-100 ml) orally in a careful manner can help in control of bloat as a first aid and then get veterinary doctor help.",
				"Sometime feeding potato, brinjal may also obstruct the food passage and leads to bloat due to obstruction of gas from the rumen.\n",
				"T:INDIGESTION",
				"Low quality feed, fungal contaminated feed, change of feed may also cause indigestion. Sometime non-availability of quality water for drinking, feeding of some toxic plat also cause indigestion.\n\n",
				"T:GOAT POX",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_disease_pox.png",
				"Goat-pox is not of uncommon occurrence, but it is less severe than the sheep-pox.  The nature of the disease is similar to that of pox in sheep.  The incubation period varies from 5 to 10 days. ",
				"The disease tends to attack male kids and ewes in milk.  Initially there may be slight pyrexia.  The lesions are not so side spread as in sheep-pox, being confined to the hairless regions of the body such as axilla, things, nose and mouth.",
				"In the female the udder may also be involved.  The lesions are typically of pox but usually are much smaller than those of the sheep-pox.",
				"The goat-pox virus is antigenically distinct from the sheep pox virus, although it is transmissible experimentally to both goats and sheep.  The goat-pox in sheep is more severe than the sheep-pox.  The goat-pox virus is anitgenically distinct from the sheep pox virus, although it is transmissible experimentally the sheep-pox.",
				"The lesions occur on  the lips and oral mucosa, the teats and udder.  The goat-pox virus affords solid protection in sheep against both goat-and sheep-pox, but the sheep-pox virus does not protect goats against the goat pox.\n\n",
				"H:Disease Management",
				"Be on the alert for signs of illness such as reduced feed intake, fever, abnormal discharge or unusual behavior.",
				"Consult the nearest veterinary aid centre for help if illness is suspected.",
				"Protect the animals against common diseases.",
				"In case of outbreak of contagious diseases, immediately segregate the sick animals from healthy one and take necessary disease control measures.De-worm the animals regularly.",
				"Examine the faeces of adult animals to detect eggs of internal parasites and treat the animals with suitable drugs.\nProvide clean and uncontaminated feed and water for minimizing the health disorders.\nStrictly follow the recommended vaccine schedule.",
				"H:Other Preventive Measures",
				"Annual vaccine with Bar-Vac CD/T. For immunizing against tetanus and overeating disease. We give 2 cc per animal. The first time an animal is given the vaccine it must have a booster shot 30 days later. We vaccine newborn kids at 20+ days old and booster shot 30 days later.",
				"Annual vaccine with Triangle® 9 + Type II BVD -  For immunizing against 9 different types of respiratory problems. We give 2 cc per animal under the skin. There must be a booster shot for the first time given. Kids must be at least 2 months old.",
				"Drench newborn kids with Bar-Guard-99. Used for the prevention of colibacillosis caused by K99 strains of Escherichia coli. Our vet told us this can also help prevent Floppy Kid Syndrome. We drench newborn kids immediately after they have their first mother's milk. We give them 2 ccs.",
				"Preventive De-worming for internal parasites. We de-worm as little as possible to try and have our animals build up resistance to internal parasites. We treat our does about 2 weeks before kidding.",
				"Regular barn cleaning. We clean our barns about every 2 weeks to give our animals as clean of environment as possible.\nTreat animals with Pro-Bios when they are given antibiotics to ensure the rumen continues to work properly.",
				"Lab testing of any Abscess. Any abscess we find on an animal is reviewed by our vet and the abscess content is tested to see if it is CL. Any animal that tests for CL will be eliminated from our farm but not sold to our customers. We do not manage CL, we eliminate it.",
				"Preventive Measures we do not take\nVaccinate for Sore Mouth. We do not vaccinate for Sore Mouth. If you have not had Sore Mouth on your farm, vaccinating for it brings live bacteria on your site and will require annual vaccinations to protect animals. If you have had Sore Mouth on your farm, any animal getting it will become immune to it when they do get it. It only lasts for around 3 weeks. We will monitor for any serious infections.",
				"Hoof Trimming. We only trim hooves on exception. We want to have animals that do not require regular trimming. If an animal does have hooves that get bad and may cause problems, we will trim them as required. We prefer that the hooves break off or chip during normal movement.\nProblems in pregnancy\n\n\nWe breed our does individually and therefore know approximately when they are scheduled to kid. This is important for us because it allows us to watch for specific problems during their pregnancy. There are two main type of problems related to pregnancy. They are Pregnancy Toxemia and Abortions. Pregnancy Toxemia is a problem that we have seen many times. We have never had a problem  that we know of where the does aborted however we have talked to friend that have had abortion problems.\n",
				"H:Pregnancy Toxemia",
				"This is a problem in the late pregnancy, normally the last month and especially last two weeks. It is normally related to a doe with multiple kids. During the last two months, the kids are adding 70% of their birthing weight. During the final weeks, there is additional nutritional requirements for the kids as continue to increase in size and  there is less and less room for the rumen to hold the same amount of food.",
				"The goats body will give the kids nutritional needs the priority  at the expense to the mother. She may not be able to consume enough nutrition and the body will start converting the mothers carbohydrates stored in her tissues. This leads to the release of keton bodies into her blood - a sign that her metabolism is faulty.\n",
				"The symptoms will be a loss of appetite, not wanting to get up or move around, sweet-smelling breath, limping and swelling of feet or walking very tenderly. Ketosis strips can be used to identify if the doe is ketotic Give doe propylene glycol twice a day.",
				" We give 60cc drench in am and pm. We also create a mixture of sodium bicarbonate with water and give 30cc drench am and pm. Help get the doe up and moving around during the day and offering her high energy food.\n",
				"T:Abortions",
				"H:Nutritional Problems",
				"Proper nutrition is essential for having healthy kids. Simultaneous deficiencies of energy and protein can cause abortion of embryos early in the pregnancy. Deficiencies of some trace minerals such as copper and iodine can be the cause of abortions. Also, excessive selenium for an extended period can cause abortions.\n",
				"H:Infectious Problems",
				"An abortion by one or more of the goats in your herd may indicate an infectious disease that needs an overall management response. It is likely that your vet will be required to identify the type of infection causing the problem.\n\nChlamydiosis - caused by an intracellular organism. Abortion typically occurs in the last 2 months of pregnancy and especially the last 2 weeks. The rest of the pregnant herd must be considered. Non bred does can catch the infection but it will result in their becoming immune. You should consider injecting pregnant does with tetracyclines by the intramuscular rout to try and prevent them from aborting.",
				"Toxoplasmosis - this is associated with a coccidium of cats. Cats become infected by consuming uncooked meat scraps, placentas, and small rodents. Goats become infected by eating grass, hay or garin contaminated by cat feces.It can result in abortion, stillbirths and weak kids. However, reducing exposure to cat may help but in may lead to an increase in rats that carry other diseases.",
				"Q Fever - a bacterial disease capable of being transmitted from animals to people caused by Coxiella burnetii, a rickettsial organism. C. burnetii may be found in sheep, cattle, goats, cats, dogs, some wild animals (including many wild rodents), birds, and ticks. Animals shed the organism in their urine, feces, milk, and especially in their birth products. Abortion or stillbirths occur in late pregnancy, but only when the placenta has been severely damaged. Treatment is with tetracycline. Placentas and aborted fetuses shoud be destroyed by burning.",
				"Brucellosis - brucella organisms infect a goats placenta and udder, causing abortion and mastitis When goats in an endemic herd are in a stressful environment and management is not adequate to control nutritional and parasitic diseases, then abortion will occur in the last 2 months of pregnancy.",
				"Listeriosis - caused by listeria monocytogenes a ubiquitous organism that may be found in soil, water, plant litter and digestive tract of ruminants. Abortions occur in the last 2 months. Treatment is usage of tetracyclines.\n\n",
				"T:BRUCELLOSIS OF GOATS",
				"Image:assets/images/livestock/goat_disease_brucellous.png",
				"H:Transmission",
				"A large number of organisms are eliminated ruing abortion. The mode of entry is by ingestion or via conjunctiva. The aborted foetus, vaginal discharge and milk from infected goats contain a large number or organisms.\n",
				"H:Symptoms",
				"In infected goats and sheep state of abortion may occur followed by a quiescent period during which a few abortions occur. The aborted animals do not breed. After 2 years or more another abortion storm is likely to occur.",
				"H:\nDiagnosis, Treatment and Control",
				"It is not possible to diagnose brucellosis on the basis of symptoms alone. The suspicion is aroused when humans in contact suffer from undulant fever and there is poor breeding record in goat herd and evidence of mastitis. ",
				"The diagnosis can be done by the isolation of organisms and by serological tests.\n",
				"There is no adequate treatment.\nThis is based on hygiene, vaccination, testing and disposal. Good management practice is essential. Separate quarters should be provided for kidding. Immunization can be done with attenuated as well as killed vaccines. ",
				"The test and disposal procedure is highly desirable.\n\n",
				"T:JOHNE`S DISEASE",
				"Johne`s disease is a specific chronic contagious enteritis of cattle, sheep, goat, buffaloes and occasionally of pigs.",
				" The disease is characterized by progressive emaciation, and in cattle and buffaloes by chronic diarrhea and thickening of the intestine.\n\n",
				"H:Transmission",
				"Under natural conditions the disease spread by ingestion of feed and water contaminated by the faeces of infected animals. ",
				"The infection occurs mostly in the early month of life. The incubation period extends from 12 months to several years. ",
				"The animal aged 3 to 6 years mostly suffer from the disease. Affected animals may not show clinical symptoms continue to discharge organisms in faeces.",
				"The organisms persist in pastures for about 1 year. The organisms are susceptible to sunlight, drying and high PH of soil; continuous contact of urine with faeces reduces the life of bacteria.\n\n"

				"H:Stock:",
				" Procure the best quality chicks. No amount of good management can convert poor quality chicks into good layers or broilers. More profit can be made in a commercial unit by procuring day old pullet chicks. In broiler units, straight-run chicks would give equally good performance.\n\nRandom sample poultry performance test: Government of India has established random sample test units for layers and broilers in four locations, viz. Bangalore, Bombay, Bhubaneswar and Delhi. The test results are published annually and give information about the performance of the various strains and breeds of chicken under identical conditions. This information would help in the choice of the stock.\n",
				"H:Number to be procured:",

				" Birds should be dewormed once in every 3 months.\nBreeder management: Breeding birds are reared for the production of hatching eggs. Care should be taken to produce maximum fertile eggs that hatch well. For this purpose males should be reared separately from the females during the growing period.

Only 10 to 12 eggs can be put under 1 hen. This method of hatching is highly unsatisfactory for large-scale production of baby chicks.",
				" Incubators, which provide similar environment as that of broody hens, but more efficiently, are used at present for hatching of eggs.\n\n",

Optimum and uniform temperature inside the incubator is very essential for obtaining satisfactory results. The incubator temperature should be maintained as recommended by the manufacturer.",
				" It usually varies from 99.5° to 100.5°F (37.2°C - 37.8°C) for forced draft-type incubators and about 1°F higher for still-air incubators. Low temperature slows down the development of embryo and higher than optimum temperature hastens the embryonic development. When abnormal temperature conditions extend over a long period, hatchability is adversely affected by increase in embryonic mortality and weak and deformed chicks.",
				"Humidity in the incubator affects hatchability.  Dry and wet bulb thermometers are used for measuring humidity.  In fowls egg takes about 21 days to hatch. The relative humidity should be around 60 per cent during the first 18 days of incubation and 70 per cent in the last 3 days for optimum hatchability. In the forced draft-type incubators the· temperature requirement decreases as the humidity increases.",
				"Fertile eggs are loaded into the incubator with broad end up. Hatchability decreases when eggs are placed in the incubator with narrow end up as the embryo develops with its head in the small end . Turning or eggs in the incubator improves hatchability. Eggs should be turned at least 4 times during a day when turning is done by hand. Modem incubators are provided with devices for automatic turning of eggs at least 8 times or more during 24 hours. In this egg trays turn through an angle of 90°. No turning is required after 18 days of incubation.",
				"Use of separate hatcher improves hatchability. When separate hatcher is used temperature is maintained at about 98°F and relative humidity at 70 to 80 per cent to obtain good hatch. Use of separate hatcher facilitates cleaning, disinfection and fumigation without disturbing other eggs.",

Although infertile eggs or eggs with dead germ do not serve any useful purpose, removal of such eggs from the incubator makes the room available for setting of more eggs. In most commercial establishments, candling is done on 17th or 18th day of incubation to save labour.",
				" Depending upon the passage of light through the egg, the eggs are classified as infertile when transparent, dead germ when translucent and eggs with live embryos when opaque. Eggs with live embryos only are transferred to the hatcher. For pedigree hatching of eggs they are to be set sire and dam wise in the incubator and also should be placed in the hatcher compartment wise, one compartment for each dam.\n\n",

They should be properly cleaned, disinfected and fumigated to kill disease organisms before storing and after transfer of eggs to the hatcher. This reduces the incidence and spread of diseases. Fumigation is usually done with formaldehyde gas using 40 ml of 40 per cent commercial formalin and 20 g of potassium permanganate for each 2·8 m3 of space inside the incubator or hatcher.",
				" Potassium permanganate may be placed in a glass or earthenware container and formalin poured over it. Fumigation should preferably be done-at the end of the working day and then the rooms closed. It is a good practice to start the incubator and the hatcher at least 24 hours before setting the eggs to maintain a constant temperature.\n",

Height of the waterers should be maintained at 2·5 cm above the back height of the chicks to reduce spoilage. Antibiotics or other stress medications may be added to water if desired. All waterers should be cleaned daily. It may be desirable to hold a few chicks one at a time and teach them to drink.\n"

				"also known in the West as Newcastle disease is a contagious and highly fatal daises of flows. In spite of the notable work done towards its control, this disease still ranks as one of the most serious virus diseases of poultry. The disease occurs in almost all countries and usually assumes a server form affecting birds of all ages. Mortality in flows varies from 50 to 100 per cent.",
				"Ranikhet disease is largely a disease of flows, but it also effects turkeys, pigenosn, grows, ducks, geese, koel pheasants, guinea-flows, partridges and doves. hedgehogs have been suspected as reservoirs of the disease. The disease is also suspected to cause conjunctivitis among laboratory workers and persons handling infected birds.",
				"H:Symptoms",
				"The symptoms vary according to the age of the affected birds. The first symptoms usually observed in young birds are sneezing, gasping and often droopiness. It is in this stage of the disease that the manifestations rather closely resemble those of infections bronchitis.",
				"Within a short time after appearance of respiratory symptoms, deaths occur in a flock in quick succession and in increasing numbers from day to day.",
				"Among growing birds and in adult sudden deaths occur in a dew instances, and are followed by a number of birds showing respiratory symptoms. The affected birds are full and depressed with ruffled feathers. These symptoms are accompanied by diarrhea, characterize by the passing of a watery stool with an offensive smell.",
				"There is profuse salivation. The saliva often accumulates in the mouth and obstructs respiration, which results in the production of gurgling disused birds may be soft - shelled and deformed. In turkeys the disease runs a very mild course. In adults, in particular, it may pass unnoticed except for some dullness, loss of appetite and other minor symptoms.\n",
				"H:Treatment and Prevention",
				"At present there is no effective treatment of any value. Proper housing and general good care are indicated in an effort to shorten the duration and severity of the infection.",
				"An early recognition of the disease and application of struck sanitary measures are of great value in the control of the disease. Some important measures for its prevention are ; slaughtering of all apparently ailing birds, segregating of in - contact in group of 10 to 15 each; removal of all infective materials such as droppings, residues of poultry cleanliness ; and provision of separate attendants for each group of birds.",
				"The poultry farm should be at a distance from place of traffic. All newly purchased birds should be kept in segregation from not less than 10 days before taking them into the farm. The poultry runs should be ploughed from time to time and lime applied thereon as a general disinfectant. As far as possible the pens and runs should be made inaccessible to free - flying birds by providing a barrier of wire - netting.\n\n",
				"H:Control",
				"Control of Ranikhet diseases can be effect with judicious application of sanitary and vaccination measures. The possibility of entry and spread of infection is considerably reduced through the maintenance of flock on deep little system and stopping all unauthorized entries, even of human beings, into the battery brooders.",
				"Disposal of fowl carcasses by burning or deep brutal to reduce the scope of carrion-eating birds like crows, kites and vultures perching near fowl pens or poultry farms helps to resume the hazards of this infection. Two types of vaccines are available in India, one for the adult birds an another for younger birds or body chicks.",
				"The virus strain for Ranikeht disease vaccine used for adult birds age over weeks was evolved at the Indian veterinary Research Institute. The vaccine consists of freeze - dried virus grown in chick embryos. Vaccination of birds 6 weeks old and above confers immunity for 1 to 3 years. Care should be taken to vaccinate bird’s not carrying heavy coccidian infection.",
				"Birds with heavy worm infection or coccidiosis are not protected even with a good vaccine. There are sometimes complications side reactions following vaccination. There are sometimes complications side reactions following vaccination with 'Mukteswar' strain of Ranikhet disease vaccine. These consist on inco-ordination of limbs and sometimes paralysis in 1 to 3 per cent to the vaccinated birds. The reactions may become more acute if the birds are affected with roundworms, coccidiosis or are weak on account of malnutrition.",

Piperazine compounds, albendazole, mebendazole etc. can be used against round worms. Against tape worms, Niclosamide, Praziquintel, Albendazole can be used.\nWhile medicating through drinking water, it should be done by mixing the required quantity of medicine in the quantity of water that chicks normally consume in 4 hours time (say approximately 6 litres per one hundred, 6 week-old chicks, per day).

				"Eventhough AI is well developed technique in cattle, is not so well developed in poultry because no standard technique is available to store poultry semen for a long period.  The techniques available at present permits to collect semen and use it for insemination immediately with or without dilution using semen diluents at 1: 2 ratio.",
				"Semen collected from one cock is sufficient for inseminating 5 to 10 hens depending upon the semen volume and sperm concentration.At farms, where AI is practiced the males are kept separately in individual cages where sufficient space is available for movement of the birds.  There should be a particular team of workers to associate collection and insemination of semen.",
				" Frequent changes of personnel in the team may affect the normal behaviour of birds.  Rough handling should be avoided, if not it may develop fear reaction, which affects the semen volume during ejaculation.\n\n",
				"H:Characteristics of Poultry Semen",
				"Semen consists of spermatozoa and seminal plasma.  Fowl semen is generally highly concentrated (3 to 8 billion spermatozoa per ml for broiler fowl).  This is due to the presence of limited amount of seminal plasma since the accessory reproductive organs are absent in avian species. ",
				"The seminal plasma is derived from the testes and excurrent ducts.  At the time of ejaculation a lymph-like fluid (also known as transparent fluid) of cloacal origin may be added to the semen in varying amounts.",
				"The addition of transparent fluid to semen at the time of ejaculation act as an activating medium for the previously non-motile spermatozoa, thus ensuring their transport from the site of deposition to the sites of sperm storage tubules in the utero-vaginal junction of the hen's oviduct.",
				"Usually cock start producing semen from the age of 16 weeks but the fertilizing capacity of the semen is low.  So the cocks from 22 or 24 weeks of age are used for semen collection. The natural colour of poultry semen is white or pearly white. ",
				"Heavy breed male can produce 0.75  to 1 ml semen and light breed male can produce 0.4 to 0.6 ml of semen. A male can be used thrice in a week for semen collection with a gap of one day.

By his right hand the operator should hold a collecting funnel and with the thumb and index finger massage the soft part of abdomen below the pelvic bones.  Massage should be rapid and continuous until the cock protrudes the papilla from the cloaca.",

				"H:Insemination:",
				"All equipment used for insemination should be thoroughly cleaned and dry before Use. Insemination must be carried out when majority of the birds completed laying since a hard shelled egg in the lower end of the oviduct obstructs insemination and lowers fertility.  In practice, inseminating chicken after 3 pm obtained better results.  In turkey flocks much better results are obtained if insemination is done after 5 pm. It is difficult to inseminate non-laying hens.  Usually insemination is done when the flock reaches 25% egg production.  Hens are inseminated twice during first week.  Then at weekly intervals.\n",
				"H:Procedure:",

When the oviduct is everted, the second operator inserts the syringe into oviduct as far as it is going inside without exerting pressure.  The insemination apparatus is introduced into the vagina about 1 inch and semen is deposited at the junction of vagina and uterus.\n\n",
				"Dose and frequency of insemination:\n            Chicken : 0.05 ml, once in a week                 \n            Turkey : 0.025 ml once in every 2 weeks\n            Ducks : 0.03 ml once in every 5 days\n            Goose : 0.05 ml for every 7 days.\n  ",

The average mortality rate is 6-10% during this period. Young poults by nature are reluctant to eat and drink in the first few days of life, primarily because of bad eyesight and nervousness. Hence, they have to be force fed.\n\nForce Feeding:\nStarve out problem is one of the major factors for early mortality in poults. So special care has to be taken for supplying feed and water. In force feeding, milk should be fed at the rate of 100ml per liter of water and one boiled egg have to be given at the rate of one per 10 poults up to fifteen days and that will compensate the protein and energy requirements of the poults.\n\nPoults can be attracted to the feed by gentle tapping of the container with the fingers. Colored marbles or pebbles placed in feeders and water will also attract poults towards them. Since turkeys are fond of greens, some chopped green leaves should also be added to the feed to improve the feed intake. Also colored egg fillers can be used for the first 2 days as feeders.\n\nLitter materials:    \nThe common litter materials used for brooding are wood shavings saw dust, paddy husk, chopped saw etc. The thickness of the litter material should be 2 inch at the beginning and may be increased to 3-4 inch in course oftime by gradual addition. The litter should be raked at frequent intervals to prevent caking."

				"Artificial insemination is the technique in which semen with living sperms is collected from the male and introduced into female reproductive tract at proper time with the help of instruments. This has been found to result in a normal offspring. ",
				"In this process, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. The first scientific research in artificial insemination of domestic animals was performed on dogs in 1780 by the Italian scientist, Lazanno Spalbanzani. ",
				"His experiments proved that the fertilizing power reside in the spermatozoa and not in the liquid portion of semen. Few further studies under research station conditions helped this technique to be used commercially allover the world including India.\n",
				"Artificial insemination is not merely a novel method of bringing about impregnation in females. Instead, it is a powerful tool mostly employed for livestock improvement. In artificial insemination the germplasm of the bulls of superior quality can be effectively utilized with the least regard for their location in far away places.",

				"The cow or dummy is secured in service create. The artificial vagina assembled is held at 45° angle from the direction of penis, and the thrust is that angle. The artificial vagina is held with the left hand by a right handed person; and when the bull mounts the cow, the sheath of the bull will be graphed by the operator, directing the gland penis into the artificial vagina, and then the bull gives a thrust to ejaculate.\n\nThe operator should evince care so as not to touch the exposed past of the penis. After the bull dismounts, the artificial vagina is taken off from penis and the air vent is opened to release the pressure from the jacket.\n\nThe water from the jacket is also drained by opening the nostle. This allows the ejaculate to flow from the cone to the semen collection tube. The semen collection tube is detached from the cone, plugged with cotton wool, and taken to the laboratory for examination. The rubber cone and the semen collection tube can be protected from external contamination or heat or higher, by covering with an insulation bag with zip.",

The inseminator will get ready by wearing a plastic apron, gumboots and gloves. The semen straw after thawing (keeping the semen straw in warm water for a minute to convert the freezed semen into liquid and the sperms become motile) is loaded in a sterilized A.I. gum and is covered with a plastic sheath. The inseminator will insert the gloved left hand into the rectum after applying the soft soap or other lubricant on the glove and back racked the animal, and the hand is further inserted and will catch hold the cervix through rectal wall.

				"H:FROZEN SEMEN AND STORAGE",
				"Freezing of semen for successful preservation of spermatozoa, for long periods, is of great importance in livestock breeding and farm management. It has made it possible” to make available the use of outstanding proven sizes for larger number of cows, covering larger area, frozen semen shipment has become possible to different continents in the globe to any place connected with any service. Now a day if farmer wants to use of an outstanding size for inheritance of high milk yield, he can go in for frozen semen service provided his area is, covered by Artificial insemination, with supply of frozen semen.\n\nAt present frozen semen is used in most of the states in India. The technique of semen preservation in straws was developed in France . Freezing of semen is done with a special diluents, which has the following composition.\nSodium citrate dihydrate (angular) 2.4 y. 2.0 gm 8.0 ml 25.0%byvolume 50,000 units per 100 ml of semen Fructose Glycerol Egg Yolk Penicillin dilulent. Dihydro-streptomycin 50.0 mg per .100m1 of semen dilulent. Distilled water double glass distilled 100.Om1. The addition of glycerol to the dilulent makes the cells more resistant to the rigours of freezing and icy crystals, which form are smaller and smoother thus creating less damage to the spermatozoa. The addition of fructose to the diluent luprores sperm resistance to glycerol; and also provides nutrition.\n\nFrozen semen is packed in single dose glass vials or plastic straws at +5°C. The final level of glycerol should be 7.0 to 7.6% during the freezing process. The antibiotics are added to inhibit bacteria and to kill pathetic organisms. The semen to be diluted in such a way that one ml. of extended semen will contain 20 million motile spermatozoa. The semen must be cooled carefully for spermatozoa to remain with life. The final temperature is lowered to -79°C or still lower. Quick freezing is done for a period of 3 to 5 minutes to -75°C with the help of atmosphere created by liquid nitrogen. In the slow freezing  technique cooling is done at the rate of 1 °C per minute from +5°C to -15°C. From -15°C to -31 °C at the rate of 2°C per minute. From -31°C to 75°C at the rate of 4 to 5°C per minute. Thus taking 40 minutes in total, further cooling to -96°C can be done quickly as it is not critical after freezing. Before freezing the diluted semen in equilibreated for 3 to 5 hours or for the best 16 to 20, hours period in refrigerator at 5°C. Frozen semen facilitates the percent use of the semen diluted and frozen, and thus the delivery price is reduced, and it can be supplied with the gaps of months to the A.I technicians as against the supply of fluid semen every days or alternate days. Liquid nitrogen plays a vital role for storing the frozen semen straws, at a temperature of -196°C for longer periods.",
				"H:Artificial insemination (AI) of cattle:",
				"Artificial insemination (AI) is the process of collecting sperm cells from a male animal and manually depositing them into the reproductive tract of a female. One can cite a number of potential benefits from the use of artificial insemination.\n\nIncreased efficiency of bull usage\nDuring natural breeding, a male will deposit much more semen than is theoretically needed to produce a pregnancy. In addition, natural breeding is physically stressful. Both of these factors limit the number of natural mating a male can make. However, collected semen can be diluted and extended to create hundreds of doses from a single ejaculate. Also, semen can be easily transported; allowing multiple females in different geographical locations to be inseminated simultaneously, and semen can be stored for long periods of time, meaning that males can produce offspring long after their natural reproductive lives end.\n\nIncreased potential for genetic selection\nBecause artificial insemination allows males to produce more offspring, fewer males are needed. Therefore, one can choose only the few best males for use as parents, increasing the selection intensity. Furthermore, because males can have more offspring, their offspring can be used in a progeny test program to more accurately evaluate the genetic value of the male. Finally, individual farmers can use artificial insemination to increase the genetic pool with which his or her animals can be mated, potentially decreasing effects of inbreeding.\n",
				"H:Decreased costs",
				"Male animals often grow to be larger than females and can consume relatively larger amounts of feed. Also, male animals are often more strong, powerful, and potentially ill-mannered and thus require special housing and handling equipment.\n\nIncreased safety for animals and farmers\nAs mentioned, male animals can become large and aggressive. These factors mean that maintaining a bull on a farm may be dangerous. Also, because of the relatively larger size of adult males than females, natural mating is more likely to result accidents and injury to either the cow or the bull than is artificial insemination.\n\nReduced disease transmission\nNatural mating allows for the transfer of venereal diseases between males and females. Some pathogens can be transmitted in semen through artificial insemination, but the collection process allows for the screening of disease agents. Collected semen is also routinely checked for quality, which can help avoid problems associated with male infertility.\nArtificial insemination has some potential drawbacks, however, that must be considered. First, it can be more laborious. Male animals instinctively detect the females that are in the correct status for conception. With artificial insemination the detection work falls on the responsibility of the farmer. Poor detection results in decreased rates of fertility. Also, increasing the number of offspring per male has selective advantages only if the best males can be accurately determined. Otherwise this process only decreases the genetic variability in a population. Increasing the number of offspring per male always reduces the gene pool. The benefits of more intense selection must be balanced against the negative effects of decreased variation.",
				"H:ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION TECHNIQUES",
				"The technique of inseminating a cow is a skill requiring adequate knowledge, experience and patience. Improper AI techniques can negate all other efforts to obtain conception.",
				"Semen must be deposited within the tract of the cow at the best location and at the best time to obtain acceptable conception rates. Early methods of AI involved deposition of the semen in the vagina, as would occur in natural mating.",
				"Those methods are not satisfactory. Fertility is low and greater numbers of sperm are required. Another method which gained popularity was the \"speculum\" method.",
				" This method is easily learned, but proper cleaning and sterilizing of the equipment is necessary, making it more impractical to inseminate than with the rectovaginal technique which is the most widely used AI method today.\n",
				"In the recto-vaginal technique a sterile, disposable catheter containing the thawed semen is inserted into the vagina and then guided into the cervix by means of a gloved hand in the rectum. The inseminating catheter is passed through the spiral folds of the cow's cervix into the uterus. ",
				"Part of the semen is deposited just inside the uterus and the remainder in the cervix as the catheter is withdrawn. Expulsion of the semen should be accomplished slowly and deliberately to avoid excessive sperm losses in the catheter. The body of the uterus is short; therefore, care should be taken not to penetrate too deeply which might cause physical injury.",
				"In animals previously inseminated, the catheter should not be forced through the cervix since pregnancy is a possibility. Since research data show little variation in conception rates when semen is placed in the cervix, uterine body or uterine horns, some people recommend incomplete penetration of the cervical canal and deposition of semen in the cervix.\n",
				"The recto-vaginal technique is more difficult to learn and practice is essential for acceptable proficiency but the advantages make this method of insemination more desirable than other known methods. With practice, the skillful technician soon learns to thread the cervix over the catheter with ease. If disposable catheters are used and proper sanitation measures are followed, there is little chance of infection being carried from one cow to another.\n",
				"H:Timing of Insemination for Maximum Conception",
				"A frequent question concerning AI is: What time during estrus should cows be bred for greatest chance of conception? Since estrus may last from 10 to 25 hours there is considerable latitude in possible time of insemination. Much research work has been conducted on this subject.\n",
				"Controlled investigations were conducted by Trim Berger and Davis at Nebraska in 1943. These and other studies show that conception rate is lower when cows are bred prior to mid estrus or later than 6 hours after cessation of estrus (standing heat in this case). Maximal conception is obtained when cows are inseminated between mid estrus and the end of standing estrus, with good results up to 6 hours after estrus.\n",
				"Success in insemination timing is dependent upon a good heat detection program. In large herds, this means assigning individual responsibility for heat detection and a continued education program for labor. A successful heat detection program and subsequent proper timing of insemination will pay dividends in increasing reproductive efficiency.",

Insemination must be carried out when majority of the birds completed laying since a hard shelled egg in the lower end of the oviduct obstructs insemination and lowers fertility.  In practice, inseminating chicken after 3 pm obtained better results.  In turkey flocks much better results are obtained if insemination is done after 5 pm.

				"H:Flies:",
				"Flies (Figure 4) are characterized by having one pair of wings. ",
				"They have complete metamorphosis with egg, larva, pupa and adult stages in their life history. ",
				"About 20 families of flies are of veterinary importance. One of the most challenging characteristics of flies is their behavior of being in contact with livestock for only short periods of time. ",
				"Adequate control can sometimes be difficult since measures must apply at precisely the right time.\n\n",
				"H:Blood-Sucking Flies\n",
				"H:Black Flies",
				"Black flies (Figure1) are small, dark, stout-bodied flies with a humpbacked appearance. The adult females blood feed mainly during daylight hours and are not host specific.",
				"It hovers about the eyes, ears and nostrils of animals, often alighting and puncturing the skin with an irritating bite. Large numbers of bites may cause weakness from blood loss, anaphylactic shock or death\n",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_black_fly.png",
				"The black fly life cycle begins with eggs being deposited on logs, rocks or solid surfaces in eddies of flowing streams. Larvae attach themselves to rocks or vegetation with a posterior sucker or threads.",
				"The length of the larval period is quite variable depending on the species and the larval environment. The adults, which emerge after pupation, are strong fliers and may fly 7 to 10 miles from their breeding sites.\n\n",
				"H:Horn Flies",
				"The horn fly (Figure 2) causes pain, annoyance and interference with feeding, resting and other normal activities. The fly pierces the skin to blood feed and is a persistent biter.",
				"With high summertime populations, they cause cattle to lose weight and lower milk production. Horn flies may cause open sores on the head and underline, which can predispose the animals to secondary infection.",
				"Flies tend to cluster at preferred sites on the host (primarily the withers and back). Because of their piercing and sucking mouth parts, they are suspected of mechanically transmitting anaplasmosis and other diseases within the herd.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_horn_fly.png",
				"Horn fly numbers of 50 or more per animal are considered to be of economic importance, although 10,000 to 20,000 per animal have been reported. Blood loss in these extreme cases can be considerable.\n\nEggs are laid exclusively in fresh (within 10 minutes of dropping) cattle manure. Larvae hatch in about 18 hours and feed on the dung, passing through 3 stages in 3 to 5 days. The pupal stage lasts 3 to 5 days, and the adults which emerge have a preoviposition period of 3 days.",
				"Mating takes place on the host, and females can lay about 200 eggs in their lifetime. The life cycle from egg to adult takes about 10 to 14 days.\n\nThe adults feed intermittently, perhaps 20 times a day, and remain on the host day and night, except for oviposition. This makes them susceptible to chemical control measures. Forced use dust bags give the best control of horn flies, although sprays, ear tags and dips may also be successfully used.",
				"Back rubbers and pour-on-materials can give control but are usually the least successful. Feed additives may be used for larval control; however, adult populations may not be affected when fly migration keeps populations at high levels.\n\n",
				"H:Horse and Deer Flies",
				"Horse flies (Figure 3) and deer flies (Figure 4), also called Tabanids, are insects that are usually strong fliers. As with mosquitoes, only females bite. They are usually daytime feeders and are vicious biters. Their attacks often account for lowered weight gains and lowered milk production.",
				"Because of their painful bites and frequent attacks, horse flies produce frenzied behavior in their hosts, sometimes causing them to run long distances in an effort to escape",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_horse_fly.png",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_deer_fly.png",
				"Tabanids introduce an anticoagulant into the wound when they bite that causes blood to ooze. These wounds are excellent sites for secondary invasion of other insects and diseases, and also cause more blood loss. Being intermittent feeders, they can be important mechanical transmitters of diseases such as anthrax, tularemia and anaplasmosis.",
				"Most species of tabanids are aquatic or semi-aquatic in the immature stage, but some develop in moist soil, leaf mold or rotting logs. Generally the eggs are deposited in layers on vegetation, objects over water, or moist areas favorable to larval development. Eggs hatch in 5 to 7 days and the larvae fall to the surface of the water or moist areas where they begin to feed on organic matter.",
				"Many species prey upon insect larvae, crustacea, snails and earthworms. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they move into drier soil, usually an inch or two below the surface. The pupal stage lasts 2 to 3 weeks, after which the adults emerge. The life cycle varies considerably between species, requiring anywhere from 70 days to 2 years. Florida has more than 122 kinds of horse and deer flies with some species present most times of the year. They are difficult pests to control. Daily mist applications will protect animals, but are difficult for most cattlemen to implement.\n\n",
				"Sand flies (Figure 5) are small biting flies, also known as punkies, no-see-ums or biting midges. All these flies breed in wet or aquatic habitats and are a difficult, almost impossible, pest to control.",
				"These flies are predominately a source of annoyance and irritation, but may also cause suffocation because of large numbers. One species is a known vector of blue tongue virus in cattle and some are intermediate hosts of helminths. Little is known of the life cycle of those attacking livestock.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_sand_fly.png",
				"H:Stable Flies",
				"The stable fly (Figure 6), or dog fly, is similar to the house fly in size and color, but the bayonet-like mouthparts of the stable fly differentiate it from the house fly.",
				"Unlike the flies previously discussed, both sexes of the stable fly are vicious biters. They are strong fliers and range many miles from their breeding site.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_stable_fly.png",
				"Stable flies cause irritation and weakness in animals and account for much blood loss in severe cases. Bite wounds also can serve as sites for secondary infection. These flies are easily interrupted in feeding and are mechanical transmitters of anthrax and anaplasmosis.",
				"Stable flies breed in soggy hay, grain or feed, piles of moist fermenting weed or grass cuttings, spilled green chop, peanut litter and sea weed deposits along beaches and in manure mixed with hay. The female, when depositing eggs, will often crawl into loose material, placing the eggs in little inner pockets.",
				"Each female may lay a total of 500 to 600 eggs in 4 separate layings. Eggs hatch in 2 to 5 days and the newly emerged larvae bury themselves, begin to feed, and mature in 14 to 26 days. While the average life cycle is 28 days, this period will vary from 22 to 58 days, depending on weather conditions.\n\nAdult flies are capable of flying up to 80 miles from their breeding site. Greater than 10 flies per animal is considered economically damaging. Higher numbers indicate heavy fly breeding in the area.\n\nStable fly control is most successfully approached with cultural control measures. Since the larvae require a moist breeding media, it is essential that they breeding source be found and dispersed to allow drying. Animal treatments are limited to fogging or mist applications of insecticide.\n\n",
				"H:Non-Blood-Sucking Flies",
				"H:Cattle Grubs",
				"Two species of cattle grubs are found in the United States, the common cattle grub and the northern cattle grub. The common cattle grub is found in Florida; however, the northern cattle grub is usually found only in cattle shipped into Florida from other states.\n\nThe common cattle grub (Figure 7) lays its eggs chiefly on the hair of cattle, attaching 5 to 15 eggs to a single hair. No pain is inflicted at the time of oviposition. In the spring (February, March, April, May) cattle gallop madly for water or shade to escape the northern cattle grub (gadding). It is apparently a reaction to the sound produced by the bee-like fly in flight.\n",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_cattle_grub.png",
				"Eggs hatch within 4 days, and the maggots burrow through the skin. Migration of the first stage larvae of the common cattle grub is through connective tissue, assisted by enzyme secretion. Common cattle grub larvae locate in the mucous membrane of the gullet. ",
				"Larvae of the northern cattle grub locate in the spinal cord. During the early fall in Florida (October-November), migrating first stage larvae begin reaching the backs of cattle where they cut or digest a breathing hole through the skin and form a warble.\n\nFirst stage larvae molt in the warble formed in the back to the second stage in 3 to 4 days. The second stage larvae molts to the third stage then grows rapidly, feeding on pus, necrotic cells and secretions from the wall of the warble or cyst. One to 2 months are spent in the warble to attain full larval growth.",
				"The grub then squeezes through the breathing hole in the skin and drops to the ground to pupate. Pupation occurs in 2 to 3 days with the pupal stage lasting 20 to 60 days, depending on the temperature. The complete life cycle requires about a year.\n\nThe larvae produce two types of injury. First there is irritation caused by larval migrations in the body of the host and later by emergence from beneath the skin. Second, the escape of the larva from the warble leaves an open, running wound that is persistent and subject to secondary infection.\n\nEconomic losses are, however, much more important. Milk production may be reduced as much as 10 to 20 percent and loss of weight resulting from the wild efforts of the animals to escape from the flies may be considerable. The value of the carcass depreciates because flesh becomes greenish-yellow and jellylike in appearance and unfit for consumption where the grubs are located. The value of the hide is also reduced because of the holes cut in the skin.\n\nTiming of treatments for control is important. The grubs must be killed before they reach the gullet or spinal cord, because killing grubs in these areas can cause swelling and possibly paralysis or death.",
				"\"Cut-off dates\" have been established in the United States for grub treatment. In Florida, grub appearance in the backs or gullets of animals occurs early, so the \"cut-off date\" has been set at August 31.\n\n The treatment period includes that time after which egg hatch has ceased until larvae have moved up to, but not into, the back or gullet region. Sprays, dips, feed additives, and pour-ons are all recommended for cattle grub control although pour-ons give best results\n\n",
				"H:Infestations of Fly Maggots (Myiasis)\n",
				"Myiasis is the presence of fly larvae in the living tissue of the host. Several kinds of maggots infest the wounds of warm-blooded animals; however, the only one that feeds exclusively on live flesh is the primary screwworm.",
				"Sterile male releases have eradicated the primary screwworm fly from the Southeast; but there is constant danger of reinfestation.\n\nOther species such as the secondary screwworm and other blow flies may also infest wounds. These species normally lay their eggs on carcasses of dead animals and may occasionally occur in the dead tissue of open wounds. Although these species may cause some damage, they will not consume living flesh and will feed on dead flesh and wound secretions. However, they may cause some tissue to die and then will feed on this dead tissue.\n\nThere is no simple way to differentiate between primary screwworms and other fly larvae. Any suspected screwworm case should be reported to the County Extension Director. Samples of eggs and maggots should be saved in a small container filled with 70% alcohol. Wounds should be treated with insecticidal ointment, sprays or dusts.",
				"H:Lice",
				"Most lice are permanent ectoparasites, spending their entire lives on the host. Both immature and adult stages are parasitic; therefore, they must remain on their hosts to survive. Each species of louse prefers a certain host. ",
				"While a species may occur on several breeds of cattle, that same species will not occur on swine or horses. Most sucking lice are specific to the site they occupy on the host.",
				"Five kinds of sucking lice (Figure 8) and one biting louse (Figure 9) are found on cattle in Florida. Sucking lice which feed on blood include the long-nosed cattle louse (found on the head, neck and brisket during winter to early spring), the short-nosed cattle louse (found on the head, neck and brisket during winter to early spring), and the cattle tail louse (the adults found principally in the tail brush and the immatures found on various parts of the body during summer to late fall and sometimes year round).",
				" The only biting louse, the cattle biting louse, feeds on skin and hair, causing itching, irritation and hair loss. It can be a severe problem in fall, winter or spring. Lice populations vary seasonally, depending largely on the condition of the host. The biting louse, and most sucking lice begin to increase in number during the fall and reach peak populations in late winter or early spring. Summer populations are usually minimal, causing no obvious symptoms. The host's \"climate\" may be extremely important.",
				" For example, skin temperature and moisture, quantity or thickness of hair, the amount of oil on the skin, and grooming behavior of the host may appreciably affect the size of the louse population. An animal under stress will usually support a larger louse population than is normal.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_long_nosed_cattle.png",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_biting_louse.png",
				"Lice are generally transmitted from one animal to another by contact. Transmission from herd to herd is usually accomplished by introduction of carrier animals, although some lice may move from place to place by clinging to flies (phoresy).\n\nFeeding lice irritate host animals, and infestations may be recognized by animal behavior. Sucking lice pierce the host's skin and draw blood. Biting lice have chewing mouthparts and feed on particles of hair, scab and skin exudations. The irritation from louse-feeding causes animals to rub and scratch, producing raw areas on the skin or loss of hair. Weight loss may occur as a result of nervousness and improper nutrition. The host often is listless. In severe cases, blood loss to sucking lice can lead to anemia and may produce abortion.\n\nFemale lice glue their eggs to the hair of the host, close to the skin. The eggs hatch in 8 to 12 days, depending on the species and temperature. The nymphs go through 3 stages and are fully developed in about 3 weeks. The usual time from egg to egg-laying adult will be about 25 to 28 days.\n\nControl of louse infestations is needed whenever an animal scratches and rubs to excess. Louse control is difficult since pesticides do not kill the louse egg. Since eggs of most species will hatch 8 to 12 days after pesticide application, retreatment is necessary 2 weeks after the first pesticide application. To prevent introduction of new louse infestations care should be taken to treat any new animal introduced into the herd.\n\nCattle tail lice are a special problem because eggs can survive and hatch up to 40 days after oviposition. A 3-week interval between treatments is recommended so most eggs will have hatched by the time the second application is made. The cattle tail louse (Figure 10) is a problem in the summer and fall seasons",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_cattle_tail_louse.png",
				"The best control of lice is accomplished with forced use of dust bags. Residual sprays, dips and pour-on materials may also give satisfactory control.\n\n",
				"H:Mites",
				"Mites have the abdomen broadly joined to the thorax with little or no evidence of segmentation. Adults and nymphs generally have 8 legs and the larval stage has 6. The life cycle of many species requires less than 4 weeks and in some it is as short as 8 days. All but a few species of mites are minute and barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nItch and mange mites (Figure 11) (Psoroptes, Sarcopte, and Chorioptes) feed on the surface or burrow just beneath the skin, making very slender, winding tunnels from 0.1 to 1 inch long. The fluid discharged at the tunnel openings dries to form nodules. A toxin is also secreted which causes intense irritation and itching. Infested animals rub and scratch continuously, often producing inflamed areas with only scattered hairs remaining. The infection may spread over the entire body, forming large, cracked scabs on the thickened skin. Infestations are contagious and treatment of all animals in a herd is essential in preventing spread.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_itch_mite.png",
				"Follicular mites are microscopic, cigar-shaped, worm-like organisms that live within the skin. All stages of the life cycle are found within the hair follicle. The mite causes nodular lesions in the skin which sometimes break, producing holes in the hide and opening the skin to secondary infection. Control is difficult because of the depth of penetration of the mites.\n\n",
				"H:Mosquitoes",
				"Mosquitoes (Figure 12) are small insects with piercing-sucking mouthparts, and scales on their wings. Female mosquitoes suck blood but do not always need blood to lay the first batch of eggs. Several species of mosquitoes attack livestock causing painful bites, unthriftiness, and occasionally death by suffocation or heavy blood loss. In addition, their attacks can cause loss of weight and decreased milk production.\n",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_mosquito.png",
				"The mosquito life cycle consists of 4 stages. The eggs are laid either directly on the water surface or on damp soil and sides of containers that will be flooded later. Common breeding sites for mosquitoes are drainage ditches, ponds, tin cans, old tires and tree holes. The eggs of most species hatch in 2 to 3 days, and the larvae or \"wigglers\" feed in the water on organic matter. The larvae pass through 4 stages in about 7 to 10 days. The pupal stage lasts 2 to 3 days, and the adult emerges from the pupal skin at the water surface.\n\nIf mosquitoes are a serious problem to livestock in your area, control measures should be implemented. The most effective control method available is source reduction by removing or draining mosquito breeding sites. Daily fogging or aerosoling for adult mosquitoes may provide relief but only as temporary control measure.\n\n",
				"H:Ticks",
				"Ticks (Figure 13) are easily distinguished from insects, since the body is not definitely divided and the strong fusion of the thorax and abdomen produces a sac-like, leathery appearance. A distinct head is lacking, but there is a head-like structure which bears recurved teeth that are inserted into the wound, allowing the tick to hold on strongly. Females can be greatly distended and are bean-like in form when fully engorged. Ticks have 4 developmental stages: egg, 6-legged seed or larval stage, 8-legged nymphal stage and 8-legged adult.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_eartick_feeding.png",
				"A fully engorged female usually deposits eggs (from 100 to 18,000) on the ground. The larval or seed ticks emerging from eggs in the soil usually climb up grasses or other low vegetation to contact passing animals. The larvae molt into nymphs and go through 3 to 5 nymphal stages (soft ticks 2-5). Ticks (Figure 14) remain in the 8-legged form in both nymphal and adult stages. The majority drop off the host to molt after feeding. Males, females and immatures all feed on blood and lymph.",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_lone_star_tick.png",
				"\n\nThe effects of ticks upon the host include inflammation, itching and swelling at the bite site, blood loss, production of wounds that may serve as sites for secondary invasion, obstruction of body openings and paralysis from the injection of toxic fluids. They also transmit many diseases, including anaplasmosis, bovine piroplasmosis and tularemia. Some ticks have the ability to transmit diseases to their offspring without feeding on a diseased animal.",
				"Tick control may be attempted through premise control with insecticides. Premise control kills ticks which are either engorged or on foliage waiting to contact a host. On animals, tick control is best achieved with insecticide sprays or dips.\n\n",
				"H:Keys to Pesticide Safety",
				"Before using any pesticide, stop and read the precautions.",
				"Read the label on each pesticide container before each use. Heed all warnings and precautions.",
				"Store all pesticides in their original containers away from food or feed.Keep pesticides out of the reach of children, pets and livestock.",
				"Apply pesticides only as directed.Dispose of empty containers promptly and safely.",
				"Recommendations in this guide are for guidelines only. The user must insure that the pesticide is applied in strict compliance with label directions.",

Most species move about a great deal and remain on the host only part of the time to obtain a blood meal. The legs are well developed and they can jump as far as 7 to 8 inches.",
				"The larvae (Figure 6) are very small worm-like, legless insects with chewing mouthparts. In several weeks they go through 3 larval stages, feeding on organic debris. The pupal stage lasts approximately one week, then the newly emerged adult flea is ready to feed on blood within 24 hours.\n\n",
				"The sticktight flea (Figure 7) is the most common flea on sheep and goats. It attaches firmly to its host usually about the face and ears. This species remains attached to its host for as long as 2 to 3 weeks. During this time eggs are laid. They drop to the ground and hatch into larvae. Large populations of this flea may cause ulcers on the head and ears. Flea infestations often spread to other animals including man.\n",

				"External Parasite Control Recommendations for Dairy Goats\nVery few pesticides are registered for control of parasites on dairy goats. Read all warnings, directions, and precautions carefully to insure proper usage.  \n\nKeys to Pesticide Safety\nBefore using any pesticide, stop and read the precautions.\nRead the label on each pesticide container before each use. Heed all warnings and precautions.\nStore all pesticides in their original container away from food or feed.\nKeep pesticides out of the reach of children, pets, and livestock.\nApply pesticides only as directed.\nDispose of empty containers promptly and safely.\nThese recommendations are guidelines only. The user must insure that the pesticide is applied in strict compliance with label directions. The Food and Drug Administration has established residue tolerances for certain insecticides in the meat and milk of certain animals. When these and other approved insecticides are applied according to recommendations, the pests should be effectively controlled and the animals' products will be safe for use as food.\n\nThe improper use of insecticides may result in residue in milk or meat. Such products must not be delivered to processing plants. To avoid excessive residues, use the insecticides recommended at the time recommended and in the amounts recommended. Remember that goats are smaller animals than cattle and require proportionately less pesticide for adequate treatment. Be careful not to over treat animals. Spray with enough pressure to penetrate the hair coat and wet the skin. Less than 1 quart of spray should be enough to produce complete coverage per animal.\n\n",

				"The wounds and skin irritation produced by these parasites result in discomfort and irritation to the animal. In Florida, the major pests on swine are lice, mange mites, ticks and stable flies, although horse flies, deer flies, mosquitoes and wound-infesting maggots may also cause severe problems.\n",
				"H:Hog Lice",
				"The hog louse (Figure 1) is the most frequently found external parasite of swine in Florida. Louse populations increase in late October and egg-laying adults can usually be found until June. High louse populations are usually found throughout the winter; however, lice also remain on the animal during the summer months.\n\n",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_pig_hoglouse.png",
				"\nInfested hogs are continually irritated by the nymphs and adults which pierce the skin to blood feed. Mature lice are about 1/4 inch in length and are gray-brown in color.\n",
				"Adults and nymphs attack principally the legs and folds of skin around the neck and ears. Each female louse lays an average of 90 eggs which are glued to the hairs. Within two weeks the eggs hatch into nymphs which mature in 10 to 14 days.",
				"Feeding lice irritate swine and infestations may be indicated by the animal's behavior. The irritation from louse feeding causes animals to rub or scratch vigorously on any convenient object, leading to weight loss. ",
				"The skin becomes thickened and sometimes it cracks and produces sores.",
				"The presence of louse infestations may be determined by examining the folds of skin around the neck and ears and also between the legs and body.",
				"H:\n\nMange",
				"Mange in swine is caused by mange mites. Two principal types of mange mites are found in Florida. Itch mites (Sarcoptic Mange (Figure 2)) burrow just beneath the skin making slender, winding tunnels from 0.1 to 1 inch long. Fluid discharged at the tunnel opening dries to form nodules. A toxin is also secreted which causes intense irritation and itching.",
				" Infested animals rub and scratch constantly producing inflamed areas which may spread over the entire body. Infestations are contagious and treatment of all animals in a herd is essential to prevent transmission.\n\n",
				"Image:assets/images/major/pm_pig_imm.png",

				"Follicular mites (Demodectic Mange) (Figure 3) are microscopic, cigar-shaped mites that also live in the skin. All life stages are found in the hair follicle. The mite produces nodular lesions which sometimes break, producing holes in the hide. Control is difficult since the mites are located deep in the hide.\n\n ",

Stable flies are proven vectors of swine diseases such as hog cholera and leptospirosis.\n\nStable flies breed in soggy hay, grain or feed, piles of moist fermenting weeds, spilled green chop, peanut litter, and in manure mixed with hay or straw. Stable fly control is most successfully approached by cultural control measures.",

Affected animals may not show clinical symptoms continue to discharge organisms in faeces. The organisms persist in pastures for about 1 year.The organisms are susceptible to sunlight, drying and high PH of soil; continuous contact of urine with faeces reduces the life of bacteria. In cattle clinical signs appear mainly during 2-6 years of age. The infected animals which are apparently healthy, often show clinical signs after parturition.\n",
				"H:Treatment",
				"The organisms is more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents invitro than Mycotuberculosis. Because of this the practical utility of treatment in clinical cases is poor.\n",

				"The affected animal should be segregated and their faeces Properly disposed off. Alive vaccine have been developed. It reduces the incidence of clinical disease. It consists of a non-pathogenic strain of Jhone`s  bacillus with an adjuvant. The calves soon after birth are inoculated with vaccine subcontaneously. The vaccinated animals become reactors of Jhonin. Vaccination is generally done in heavily infected herds.\n"

The disease occurs in almost all countries and usually assumes a server form affecting birds of all ages. Mortality in flows varies from 50 to 100 per cent.",
				"Ranikhet disease is largely a disease of flows, but it also effects turkeys, pigenosn, grows, ducks, geese, koel pheasants, guinea-flows, partridges and doves. hedgehogs have been suspected as reservoirs of the disease. The disease is also suspected to cause conjunctivitis among laboratory workers and persons handling infected birds.",
				"H:Symptoms",
				"The symptoms vary according to the age of the affected birds. The first symptoms usually observed in young birds are sneezing, gasping and often droopiness. It is in this stage of the disease that the manifestations rather closely resemble those of infections bronchitis.",
				"Within a short time after appearance of respiratory symptoms, deaths occur in a flock in quick succession and in increasing numbers from day to day.",
				"Among growing birds and in adult sudden deaths occur in a dew instances, and are followed by a number of birds showing respiratory symptoms. The affected birds are full and depressed with ruffled feathers. These symptoms are accompanied by diarrhea, characterize by the passing of a watery stool with an offensive smell.",
				"There is profuse salivation. The saliva often accumulates in the mouth and obstructs respiration, which results in the production of gurgling disused birds may be soft - shelled and deformed. In turkeys the disease runs a very mild course. In adults, in particular, it may pass unnoticed except for some dullness, loss of appetite and other minor symptoms.\n",
				"H:Treatment and Prevention",

				"An early recognition of the disease and application of struck sanitary measures are of great value in the control of the disease. Some important measures for its prevention are ; slaughtering of all apparently ailing birds, segregating of in - contact in group of 10 to 15 each; removal of all infective materials such as droppings, residues of poultry cleanliness ; and provision of separate attendants for each group of birds.",
				"The poultry farm should be at a distance from place of traffic. All newly purchased birds should be kept in segregation from not less than 10 days before taking them into the farm. The poultry runs should be ploughed from time to time and lime applied thereon as a general disinfectant. As far as possible the pens and runs should be made inaccessible to free - flying birds by providing a barrier of wire - netting.\n\n",

				" The list of districts selected for this purpose based on the population of female cross-bred and high yielding cattle and of buffaloes as per 17th livestock census as the main criterion is given in Annexure-I. ",
				" The scheme is to be implemented in these districts only.\n\n",
				"H:5. Selection of Insurance Companies ",
				"In order to get the maximum benefit in terms of competitive premium rates, easier procedures of issue of policy and settlement of claims, Chief Executive Officer will be empowered to decide upon the Insurance company(s) and the terms and conditions. While selecting Insurance Company, besides premium rates offered, their capacity to provide services, terms and conditions and service efficiency should also be taken in to account.",
				" The CEO will invite quotations in writing from those public and private general insurance companies having a fairly wide network in the state or a considerable part of the state. The CEO should select the Insurance Company/Companies after negotiating with the insurance companies for successful and efficient implementation of the scheme and popularizing the scheme amongst the livestock owners.",
				"  If any Insurance Company is offering cover for any type of disability in addition to death of the insured animal, such offer could be considered, however, no subsidy in the premium for such additional risk coverage will be provided. The entire cost of premium on account of the risk coverage other than death of the animal has to be borne by the beneficiaries.",
				"  However, if any additional risk covers is offered as a package along with death cover and the premium rate is not exceeding the maximum limit of 4.5% for annual policies and 12% for three year policies, such offer could be accepted and subsidy could be provided. As mentioned above, the CEO has to ensure that the premium rate agreed to is competitive.",
				"  Under no circumstances, the rate of premium should exceed 4.5% for annual policies and 12% for three year policies.  Normally, a single insurance company should be entrusted for insurance with the work in a district. However, for the purposes of encouraging competition and popularizing the scheme more than one insurance company may be allowed to operate in a district, if other terms and conditions are remaining same.",
				" Default in settlement of claim or any types of deficiency in services on part of Insurance Companies could be brought to the notice of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority which is a nodal authority in the country in this regard.\n\n",
				"H:6. Involvement of Veterinary practitioners",
				"The active involvement of the veterinary practitioners at the village level is required for the successful implementation of the scheme.  They are to be associated with the work of identification and examination of the animals to be covered under the scheme, determination of their market price, tagging of the insured animals and finally issuing veterinary certificates as and when a claim is made.",
				" Besides, being in touch with the farmers and cattle-rearers, they may also help in promoting and popularizing the scheme. As far as possible, only the veterinary practitioners working with the state government may be involved.  Private veterinary practitioners may be involved only if Government veterinary practitioners are not available.",
				"  A list of such veterinary practitioners will be prepared for every district by the district officer of the Department of Animal Husbandry. The list of veterinary practitioners will be made available with the insurance company selected for the district as well as to the concerned Panchayati Raj bodies.\n\n",

				"H:7. Commencement of Insurance policy cover and adjustment of premium subsidy",
				"In order to generate confidence among the cattle owners about the efficacy of the scheme, it is important that the policy cover should take effect once the basic formalities like identification of animal, its examination by the veterinary practitioner, assessment of its value and its tagging along with payment of 50% of the premium to the insurance company or its agent by the cattle owner.",
				"  The selected insurance company will have to agree to this.  However, it is possible that the insurance company may point out a provision in the Insurance Act that insurance cover can take effect only after the whole premium is paid in advance.  In order to take care of this problem, there could be an arrangement by which certain amount is paid in advance to the insurance company directly by the CEO.",
				"  This amount should not exceed 50% of the premium of the number of animals expected to be insured in a period of 3 months.  The insurance company, on its part, should issue instructions to their branches that as and when 50% of the premium is paid by the cattle owner, they should issue the policy by suitably adjusting the balance 50% from this advance.  The insurance company should prepare monthly statements of the policies issued indicating the assessed value of each animal and the Government share for each district duly countersigned by the district officer of the Animal Husbandry Department and submit to the CEO so that, that much amount can be recouped to the insurance company by the CEO.",
				"  Target of getting the number of animals insured in a three months period for payment of advance to the Insurance Company should be on realistic basis and recouping of the advance fund should be on the basis of subsequent progress made by the concerned insurance Company. As the scheme in its present form will not continue beyond 31st March, 2007, the CEO should, as far as possible, ensure that no advance is outstanding with the insurance company beyond that period. ",
				" In any case, if any such amount remains outstanding, the insurance company should be asked to pay the same forthwith in the first week of April, 2007.  This should be suitably incorporated in the agreement to be executed with the insurance company.\n\n",
				"H:8. Animals to be covered under the scheme and selection of beneficiaries",
				"All those female cattle/ buffalo yielding at least 1500 litre of milk per lactation are to be considered high yielding and hence can be insured under the scheme for maximum of their current market value. ",
				" Animals covered under any other insurance scheme/plan scheme will not be covered under this scheme. Benefit of subsidy is to be restricted to two animals per beneficiary and is to be given for one time insurance of an animal up to a maximum period of three years.",
				" The farmers will have to be encouraged to go for a three-year policy which is likely to be more economical and useful for getting the real benefit of insurance on occurrence of natural calamities like flood and drought etc. However, if a livestock owner prefers to have an insurance policy for less than three years period for valid reasons, benefit of the subsidy under the scheme would be available to them also, with the restriction that no subsidy would be available for further extension of the policy.",
				" Field performance recording of the NPCBB could also be involved for identification of beneficiaries. The Gram Panchayats will assist the Insurance Companies in identifying the beneficiaries.\n\n",
				"H:9. Determination of market price of the animal",
				"An animal will be insured for the maximum of its current market price. The market price of the animal to be insured will be assessed jointly by the beneficiary, authorized veterinary practitioner and the insurance agent.\n\n",
				"H:10. Identification of insured animal",
				"The animal insured will have to be properly and uniquely identified at the time of insurance claim. The ear tagging should, therefore, be fool proof as far as possible. ",
				"The traditional method of ear tagging or the recent technology of fixing microchips could be used at the time of taking the policy.",
				" The cost of fixing the identification mark will be borne by the Insurance companies and responsibility of its maintenance will lie on the concerned beneficiaries. The nature and quality of tagging materials will be mutually agreed by the beneficiaries and the Insurance Company. ",
				"The Veterinary Practitioners may guide the beneficiaries about the need and importance of the tags fixed for settlement of their claim so that they take proper care for maintenance of the tags.\n\n",
				"H:11. Change of owner during the validity period of insurance",
				"In case of sale of the animal or otherwise transfer of animal from one owner to other, before expiry of the Insurance Policy, the authority of beneficiary for the remaining period of policy will have to be transferred to the new owner. The modalities for transfer of livestock policy and fees and sale deed etc required for transfer, should be decided while entering into contract with the insurance company.\n\n",
				"H:12. Settlement of Claims",
				"The method of settlement of claim should be very simple and expeditious to avoid unnecessary hardship to the insured.  While entering into contract with the insurance company, the procedure to be adopted/documents needed for settlement of claim should be clearly spelt out.",
				"In case of claim becoming due, the payment of insured amount should be made within 15 days positively after submission of requisite documents. While insuring the animal, CEOs must ensure that clear cut procedures are put in place for settlement of claims and the required documents are listed and the same is made available to concerned beneficiaries along with the policy documents.\n\n",
				"H:13. Effective monitoring of the scheme",
				"The present scheme is a pilot scheme only. The continuance of the scheme during XI plan will be considered after critical review of the scheme during pilot stage. In view of this, there is need of strict monitoring at different stages. The monitoring should be in terms of financial releases, number of animals insured and type of insurance.",
				" Monitoring at the Central and State levels is extremely important. CEO will be required to make special efforts for effective monitoring. Secretary in-charge Animal Husbandry in State Government/Director of state animal Husbandry will take periodic review of the implementation of the scheme.\n\n",
				"H:14. Payment of honorarium to the veterinary practitioners",
				"The involvement of veterinary officer in the scheme is from beginning to end. His active interest and support is essential for success of the scheme. In view of this it is essential to provide some incentive to the veterinary practitioners to motivate them to carry out these activities wholeheartedly. ",
				" It has been decided to pay an honorarium of Rs.50/- per animal at the stage of insuring the animal and Rs. 100/- per animal at the stage of issuing veterinary certificate (including conducting post-mortem, if any) in case of any insurance claim. Central Government will provide the amount needed for payment of honorarium to the S.I.As. ",
				" The CEOs should ensure that Boards will pay to Veterinary Practitioners at end of each quarter depending on number of animals insured and veterinary certificates issued by them in that quarter. \n\n",
				"H:15. Publicity",
				"The scheme is new and people inclusive of the concerned officials are not much aware of the scheme.",
				" Therefore, public as well as the machinery involved in this have to be made aware of the scheme and benefits thereof. Pamphlets, posters, wall paintings, radio talks, TV clippings etc. will help in creating awareness among the farmers about the benefits of insuring their high yielding animals under the scheme.",
				" Publicity campaigns on special occasions like animal fairs etc. will also be taken up for wide publicity. The Panchayati Raj institutions will be involved in publicity in a big way. The task of disseminating information on the scheme and inviting farmers to offer their animals for identification for insurance will be entrusted to the Intermediate Panchayats.",
				"For this purpose the CEOs are empowered to provide assistance not exceeding Rs.5000/- for each intermediate Panchayat (in both cash and in the form of publicity material).\n\n",
				"H:16. Commission to Insurance Agents",
				"The active and dedicated involvement of insurance agent is most essential for efficient implementation of the scheme. The insurance company should be persuaded to pay at least 15% of the premium amount to the agent out of their premium income.  While entering into contract with the Insurance Company, this has to be ensured by the implementing agency.\n\n",

				"H:3. Sheep and Goat Insurance",
				"All indigenous, crossbred and exotic sheep and goat will be covered under this scheme. The policy shall provide indemnity against death of sheep and goats due to accident including fire, lightning, flood, cyclone, famine, earthquake, landslide, strike, riot or diseases occurring during the period of insurance.",
				" The market value of sheep and goats varies according to breed to breed area and to time. The Veterinarian’s recommendations is considered the acceptance of insurance as well as for settlement of claims depends on two inspection report of the veterinary officer.\n\n",
				"H:4. Livestock Insurance Scheme",
				"The scheme is implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Government of India. Under the scheme, the crossbred and high yielding cattle and buffaloes are insured at their current market price, which is assessed jointly by the beneficiary, authorized veterinary practitioner and the insurance agent.",
				" The premium of the insurance is subsidized by 50%. The entire cost of the subsidy is being borne by the Central Government. The benefit of subsidy is being provided to a maximum of 2 animals per beneficiary for a policy for maximum of three years.\n\nAll those female cattle/ buffalo yielding at least 1500 litre of milk per lactation are considered as high yielding and hence can be insured under the scheme for their current market value. Animals covered under any other insurance scheme/plan scheme will not be covered under this scheme. Benefit of subsidy is to be restricted to two animals per beneficiary and is to be given for one time insurance of an animal up to a maximum period of three years.

				"Since the udder and teats in buffaloes are different compared to cattle, milking machines for cattle have to be modified in order to fit buffaloes. ",
				"In general, a heavier cluster, a higher operation vacuum and a faster pulsation rate is required. Results from recent studies in India indicate that it might be possible to reduce the cluster weight and the frequency of liner slip by applying an appropriate combination of liner design and cluster weight.",
				"It is not only the total weight of the cluster that is important, but also the distribution of its weight on the udder. ",
				"Unequal weight distribution can cause uneven milk output.",
				" The long milk and vacuum tubes should be aligned and stretched to ensure equal weight distribution of the cluster on the udder.",
				"Milking characteristics depend upon vacuum levels and pulsation rates among others. ",
				"Studies on Egyptian buffaloes revealed that a vacuum of 51 kPa and a pulsation rate of 55 cycles/min led to much longer milking times than a vacuum of 60 kPa and a pulsation rate of 65 cycles/min (6.21 min. compared to 3.18 min.). ",
				"The higher vacuum level, however, caused a significant increase in the somatic cell counts. Highest milk yield within an acceptable time were found when using 56 kPa and 65 cycles /min. ",
				"In all trials a pulsation ratio of 50:50 was used. Studies in Pakistan indicated that the pulsation rate and ration should be 70 cycles/min and 65:35 respectively for Nili-Ravi buffaloes.",
				" In Italy, the majority of farms use the same machines for both buffaloes and cattle.",
				" It is a simple ”cattle machine” with one vacuum level operating at approximately 40 cm Hg.",
				"In India, recent trials have been made with milking with Duovac TM from Alfa Laval Agri. ",
				"Successful milking was done with a vacuum level of 55 kPa, 70 cycles/min pulsation rate and pulsation ratio of 65:35 for milk flows above 0.2 kg/min.",

				"This in turn will lead to economic loss for the farmer and eventually he will loose his faith in machine milking.\n\n",
				"H:Introducing machine milking",
				"The concept of machine milking should be introduced slowly and by persons who the buffaloes are used to and feel comfortable with under the supervision of an expert from Alfa Laval Algri.",
				"The procedure of introducing buffaloes to machine milking presented below an recommended by Alfa Laval Agri is applicable for a whole herd where neither animals nor humans are familiar with machine milking.",
				" By carefully following the mentioned steps, a successful introduction should be possible.\n\n",

				"Training of milkers should be done by a person from the milking machine company. ",
				"This person has good knowledge about biology of milking, machine milking as well as with the design, function and maintenance of the milking equipment.",
				" The training should include introduction procedures, milking routine, handling of the machine, cleaning and maintenance as well as certain aspects of the day-to-day service of the machine.",
				"Installation of the milking machine in the barn and any other modification in the barn should be made well in advance of the changing to machine milking.",
				"It is most appropriate to start with heifers since it is easier to habituate heifers than older buffaloes to machine milking. Older buffaloes may have been hand milked by a certain routine for several lactations and may respond negatively to a change in routine.",
				" Heifers on the other hand are not accustomed to any specific routine and are more likely to accept machine milking as well as hand milking.",
				" Furthermore their udders and teats are more uniform and not damaged by previous milking. ",
				"Liner slip and other negative effects of machine milking is therefore less pronounced in heifers. ",
				"Note that heifers should not be hand milked but directly introduced to the machine. ",
				"They may get accustomed to the noise of the vacuum pump etc. by participating in the milking routines prior to partus.",
				"Calm animals that are comfortable with hand milking should be selected. ",
				"The udders and teats of the animals should be uniform with respect to conformation and size. ",
				"Buffaloes in heat or unhealthy animals or animals with previous let-down-problems should not be selected.",
				"Milk the old and selected animals as usual by hand but let the vacuum pump run during milking.",
				" This will make the animals accustomed to the noise. Put the pump on before actual milking, but after the buffaloes have been tied up, otherwise the animals may be startled by the sudden noise.",
				" Repeat the procedure (usually 2 to 4 times) until all buffaloes are accustomed to the noise. It is better to repeat this procedure once or twice more until all buffaloes are comfortable, than rushing into the next step.\n",

				"Bring the milking machines into the barn. Connect them to the airline and place them at each buffalo’s place at the same time as hand milking is carried out. This will allow the buffaloes to get used to the ”ticking” sound of the pulsator. It will give them a chance to look at the machines and smell them and may be even taste them. Make sure though, that they do not chew on them! Move the machines to the next buffalo in order to milked. This makes the buffaloes used to machines being moved around. The procedure should be repeated (usually 2 to 4 times) until all the animals have accepted the presence of the machines.",
				"At this stage, presumably all buffaloes will be well accustomed to the new routine. If some buffaloes are still showing signs of nervousness or stress, it is recommended to repeat the above mentioned steps until the animals are calm. Buffaloes that after this procedure have not accepted being milked by machines should be returned to hand milking. One or two frightened or uncomfortable buffaloes might cause major disturbances in the whole herd.\n\nConsistency with respect to milking routine including pre-milking preparation should be applied from the beginning of the introduction period. The regular milker should carry out the machine milking during the introduction period.\n\nWhen the cluster is firmly attached to the udder, the milker should stay with the buffalo to see that she is comfortable. Soft talking and brushing and scratching are the best ways to calm an animal. These first sessions of machine milking usually require longer time than the following. However, this time is well worth spending to assure forward calm and easy-milking buffaloes.\n"
